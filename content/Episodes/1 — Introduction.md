## Parting Words
Teacher OT gives a speech:
- Magaambya’s Philosophy: Emphasises the importance of understanding and embracing individual differences, as they are the source of magic.
- Source of Magic: Unique qualities and traits, even those considered negative or different, can manifest as magical abilities.
- Unlocking Magic: Understanding and accepting one’s true self, even if it involves confronting fears or societal norms, is crucial for harnessing magical potential.

OT asks us:

> What about you defines you, even if others rarely notice it?
> Is there something inside you that pulls at you, perhaps defying rational explanation?
> Who are you, and how can that person best be guided to grow? #Followup
