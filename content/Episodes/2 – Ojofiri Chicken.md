## Ojofiri Chicken
Haibram and [[Anchorroot]] task us with finding [[Ojofiri chicken]] from the [[Kafesi Market]] for the [[Rain-Scribes]]

We ask locals for directions & learn that the market is west of the city. 
After some searching, we find the right place & buy 6 chickens from [[Makena]] for 20 gold & return them to [[Anchorroot]]

We agree to return to return to the markets in the afternoon
