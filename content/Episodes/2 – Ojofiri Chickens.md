# Transcript

I Oh, that's why they don't sync up.

I understand what happens now. When you start recording with people don't join until they make a sound.

So that's why there's an offset at like not everyone sinks off because I mean I found them to be like like they do like you just have to offset the things slightly, but I I found them essentially offset by a feeacist and that would explain it. Because like, uh like it's got uh fill joining at zero, me joining at three was siximbu 17, correct 24 I'm like yeah, that makes sense.

Yeah, but I mean generally the ones that download have that amount of light space at the start.

At least that's how it was for me.

I saw like another file that sort of mentioned the same thing, but it hasn't been the case for me.

It's not a big dealer.

Which ones do you downloads around?

Like the now I forget what the is.

It's it's like the zip files, the fla, and then yeah. Okay because I think I do an in four format but yeah, I mean, whatever. Yeah yeah. Um okay. Um we get to to get into this.

Everyone is on.

We got Craig here. Um so more or less we just got back to the hole, didn't we?

Dining hall, yeah.

I think Ezzy or like not far away at least. um , I'm this one. 17 for no particular reason. , I changed that last that's.

Okay, cool. So. Uh I think with the podcast stuff we're planning on doing like a pre-recorded intro, right?

So I'm not doing my normal big intro.

We're still cool with that approach.

Sure.

I think it probably will save time in the long run once we're used to it once we know what it is and stuff. Um and then like we can sort of li with low energy, but I can sort of just ease into it a little bit more at like a lower gear or a higher gear sort of depend on what I want to do like anyone have any thoughts on that.

Look for me I think just to make sure that at the start of the episode, you clearly I mean it's gonna happen because we're starting new each time anyway, but just to make sure that that' sufficient context of where we're starting each time an introduction like I've got like a a few lines like a paragraph um and I think that's good to do as normal um but like you guys won't be introduced as normal like that's the main difference and I won't do my big hello and welcome to this.

It basically just like this is what we did this is where we are.

Yeah, yeah if I was in the I would write the thought of the intro basically at the end of the session so that you can remember to summarize like where we we ended up, but that's up to you.

It is better if I was to do it that way.

I've done this long enough that I know that it is better.

It's harder when I have to remember it, but it is sometimes better as well because that puts me in my mindset of what happened.

But then I don't know.

But you're right.

I should I should get into the habit of doing it straight after. . I just say it at the end and then like we can you can either retake it or just leave it like that and we can put it on the next thing.

That's true.

Maybe we just record it as a special thing at the end and just put post that somewhere. We could all we could all jump in on that too.

These are all good thoughts.

Anyone else have thoughts of a technical or nature or otherwise?

Thoughts had empty. Cool.

Well, in our first episode, we wereuced to the party as they began their journey as initiates of the Mambia, which is the oldest and arguably greatest magic school and Gularian.

They met their first teacher, Takalu O, who asked them several questions and put them through a series of simple tests to see how they performed as a group.

At the end of this they selected a magical symbol which granted them a small glimmer of magical power, a cantrip, and asked a final question about what defines them, which which would help guide their journey as initiates at the school.

After this, they were told to head to the dormitory, where they met a couple of students and settled into their new rooms.

Ei Giana, one of their fellow students, gave them a quick tool with extended stops at two locations, the dining hall and the supply store.

With the dining hall, they met head cook Yao and told about meal schedules and some work opportunities and at the supply store, they met Zhan and given their initial supplies.

Throughout this day, they had been given several beads, which they would collect as part of their journey at the Mambia.

And and currently, they're just at the dinner on the first day and are about to learn more about their duties over the next few days.

So I think we said that you were with Essie.

She was taking you out to dinner, even though it is just a you were very close to the dining hall.

It's just a short walkway. And so and soie would say ah, good to see you all.

Should we go to head to dinner then?

Yes, that's.

I have no idea whether I'm doing the right.

I'm probably going to mess up a lot of my voices, but such is life. , okay, uh we might might see a couple of the students.

Uh, people have different schedules.

Sometimes they take dinner at home, uh well the dormitory, uh so we might see some people tonight, we might not, um but I told people that they will be there, so hopefully we see a couple of people.

As long as it' sounds good to Yeah, and it'll be nice to meet the other students around here.

Yeah. Um sure you guys head over.

It is raining.

It's not raining heavily right now, but like the rain comes and goes in this place. Um you um when you get there, you smell uh the delicious aroma of roasted chicken um uh vegetable soup um you also there are some also like a couple of salads on offer and some breads um and uh some roasted vegetables as well. Um So there's quite a decent spread on offer.

That's straight for the line.

I'm assuming it's kind of like dorm style where there's lots of trade set out and uh Lumacy says uh don't worry uh we'll make sure you eat. Uh give you uh give you lots of chicken. . All right and I'll line up find them and I yeah, I presume we' get the same feed.

Is that right?

Yeah, whatever you want, you can basically get it served whatever you want, um and load up your plate with whatever you whatever you desire out of what I just mentioned.

I'd probably grab a soup bowl and start putting in all the things inside the soup bowl. , I'll you that you like a tray with the different things on.

I want to bowl. Give you the biggest bowl they can and you can just start loading it up. Bowls for their salads, but I'll just grab one of the sandwich trays and fill it up with some chicken and some salad and maybe a couple of other things.

Yeah, you all load up your plates. Um asie does as well. Um as you're sitting down, a couple of other students come up um that asie points out and says, oh, that's Hebram um and Mariama. Um that she points out to a um a handsome musty looking dwarf, clean shaven. Um and a young woman, um dark skinned, um sort of with like somewhat darting eyes, looking a little bit erratic maybe, but um she is somewhat focused on the group and she says, ah, Hebram, Mariama, come meet the new students. Um that's uh the dwarf is Hebram, um and the human is uh Mariama. Um why don't you introduce yourselves?

Oh, hi hi there.

I'mram and I'm I'm been Bristol.

It's lovely to see you here.

So we'll have a lot of fun this year.

Is Abram a dwarf?

Yes.

Yeah.

Okay, and then how do you spell Mariama?

M A R I am A. MARIA.

I'm guessing that's an H at the start of paper?

I was here on eight. ? I go either way.

I'll probably just to meet you with a mouthful we can everything. Well met. So you'll be you'll be getting to know the ways of the school then.

I uh I think I have I'm giving you the trial tomorrow.

Shouldn't we go through theory?

Well, trial not so much a trial trial. Uh uh service work, uh service projects for the schools get to know what it's like to be uh students of the Ngambia. What's involved?

Uh, well, um, basically, uh, it's one for every of the um every of the each of the standard bearers. The cascade birds, the five branches of Mambia, the cascade bearers, the ringsribes, the tempest sunes, the emerald bows and the uzoganti emeraldows. What I mean if you're not allowed allowed to say spoil it, but what you have installed for the emerald?

That will be be a surprise.toiled I have no idea anyway.

I I think uh tomorrow we'll be doing something for the transcribes, but I' gotta keep it a secret. Uh it's as part of the just getting to know you a simple test.

Anyway, I'll I'll go get some food.

I'll be back in a second.

Um, see you around there. They come back in a second with food and sit down, um and you guys can talk a little bit more about the trial. Um but uh so have you all thought about what branch you want to represent already or are you looking to learn more about them?

Well I introduce myself as Leanna and everything and I say well I wanted to learn a bit about each of the branches before I make a final decision.

I suppose that's all what part of the these tests are about I think I'm going to be in the emeraldouse, but maybe not who knows?

I've heard good things about the cascade bearers, but I am to everything.

Mariama speaks up I think it's good to be open to new things.

Try them out.

See what they like.

Maybe you think one thing is good and you find something else works better for you.

Maybe.

What about you big guy? . May want to learn more.

I'm kind of new to all of this and I'm only a simple apple farmer.

Plenty of farmers come through this place.

Really?

Yeah, lots of people with interested in nature.

I certainly have an interest in nature.

I'm wonder you might get along well with anchor root.

And who is he, or she?

She uh I think you'll meet her pretty soon.

She uh she can be a bit flaty. Um she's in she's a she's a resident um uh rain scrab, I suppose you would say. Uh she I work with her a lot. Um uh she's very interested in nature. Has a collection of caterpillars and insects. Um fascinating.

Although caterpillars are usually great for trees.

Oh, it's a whole circle of life, isn't it?

Yes, I guess.

But you can be a bit shy, so you might not see her as much as the rest of us.

Interesting.

A be interested in meeting her, maybe I can give her an apple.

And as he says this, he creates two apples and hands them to Abraham and Mariama.

Mariama, yeah.

Oh, oh thank you. Happy to see new life blooming.

Yes, me too.

So, what do you guys do for fun around here?

I ask study, learn, spa, um hang out in the gardens.

Sometimes I like to go into the city, uh go find things to do, earn some extra coin. That's a lot of options. Why should I start?

I guess I should be getting off to a good start with the studying, so try and keep my head in the books for now.

There's nothing wrong with books.

Yeah, we're all here because we want to learn so I kid I kid.

No worries. Uh, but then, you're ever up for a spa.

I'm I'm I'm happy to meet you in the spa in field.

We can I'll get my ax and my arm ready.

We can have a a bit of a go back and forth.

I was thinking of a different type of spa. We have the bath oh yes true I just immediately I thought of like like a sweat room that type of thing I wasn't thinking about combat sparring my bad and we are also expected to find things to do for the good of the people as we can and that's essentially what you'll be doing this week just as part of your next part of your initiation, your orientation to the school. Fair enough.

Yeah, so you guys keep on talking for a little bit, keep on chatting. Um and then eventually, um you guys can retire to back to the dormitory.

Do you guys do anything like before you go to bed?

It's just raining so I don't need a shower. That's entirely how that works.

Yeah, you don't know how rut work.

It's fine.

Well I'm I'm not going to do anything too exciting but I will take a a bath and do a little lude practice before I go to bed. Leave the door open again and cut up will be closed tonight' relatively take on I'm on the right side, near the common room, um, but uh toward the bottom right corner of the common room.

Okay. Um So as you go into the baths, um I'm assuming you go to the the nearby one, um Yeah, um as you going to the bars, um roll initiative. Am I going to slip um me . One second I go I'll just I'll just use theice.

I'll use the roll twinning this tunnel I roll 20.

Initiative is wisdom right here.

I think it kind of depends on a few things.

It can be a few things.

Yeah, I'm just letting builder tell me that it's a cloth and running with it you guys can be may not be you may not get to do much, but um so to be clear, um this is on the way so I'm not yet the uh the you get into the bath and then something happens.

I will be now descriptive. Um but I'll I sort of wanted to roll some stuff at first.

Sure.

Well, I rolled a an out to me.

Oh, that's very good.

So it's the 20 and the not 20.

I still I'm still in that stage where I've got to get to know all your names as well.

Ukku is my name.

It'sic. By name on to my name, my character name.

Yeah, that does help.

Or at least if you change the role as Okay, so what was initiatives?

Pho?

Total?

Yeah.

Laurie 12 Uu uh nine.

I mean I thought it was a plus but it says plus zero on my path builder yeah I think most people have crappy percept it's not based on you can argue a case to a few other skills for initiative but generally it's just done off perception initiative it's the seven because you I rolled one but I got a five to my perception so total six six Paul got 27 I got three Okay, so as you're going into the bathroom as you're in this changing room, um uh give me a perception check.

Let's You're not kind of believe that I got 27 again.

Well, no, no, I did. Assistant.

Um, okay, so as um well, in that case, um I I'm I think I had this right, but I'm I'm not an expert at part final jury.

I think you hear something rustling um in a like a pile of towels.

Oh, I think I was alert. Um okay, so I guess I will I hear something wrestling I guess I'll like sneak up to the towns and try and pull them out, pull up, see what's going on. Uh yeah, as you pull up the spell like the thing, um you see a lizard um like looking up at you like it's got a thrill like and it's frills like go um but it's not made of like skin it seems to be made out of like paper um um all right well yeah it seems to be out of like yeah paper okay well I will mention I have animal elocutionist I suspect that it wouldn't work here because most animals aren't made of paper um so um so it just cases not me that you've unveiled it right I'm looking at it and it it's it's reactive to finding it that's all..

There's definitely like drawing and writing on these paper as well.

It's not like blank paper. . So if I like it's not clear to me that it's trying to fight me so I'm just going to try and pick it up. You going to pick it up.

It's like fighting against you, I suppose me athletics check.

Okay. Set up one.

I got a four. It beats you unless it gets in that one, it's gonna do better than you.

I go in that one. Uh you grab it then.

It has a plus five acrobatics, but that six but it's one less success so you grab it yeah.

All right. Well um okay.

I've got this paper lizard in my gras but I presume it's still trying to wriggle around but um if I try and unfold it, does that work?

We call that two actions.

Okay.

Yeah, like I'm we're in initiative, but I'm not sure if you really like you have a third like moving to it with one action grabbing it with a second action, so you have one action left and you're gonna try to like rip it apart, I suppose. Just make an unarmed attack. Definitely a way to do that. Apologies just a minute . No, you're right.

This is our first combat.

I feel like it's going to be very underwhelming, but that's okay.

Like this is a this is happening in a bathroom.

That's the perfect.

I thought I was going to be come back with like a bar of soap or something.

He slipped and fill it out of his grasp that's.

Oh, can't wait. What is this doing?

I have doing this , what is it?

What does that's um I'll just be 17 hits.

Yay and on on does some damage that I know the day before?

Let's say it's a day four.

I' run with it later. The three plus strength.

I'm guessing is zero.

All right, right.

Yeah, yeah. Um so three damage. Hip. Cool. Um do you like yell for help or anything?

It's a piece of paper.

What am I why would I be yelling for help?

Okay. Um I'll let people do perception checks on their turn then um so after your turn it's its turn.

So it officially does do a thing oh it is an action so it does this on its turn.

It does that and then then it's going to try to attack you um and it gets a 15 does it 15 So you take damage and you need to make a will save What did you get for your It sounds hard. , I got a 15.

Okay, you are not frightened of this lizard that I said, why would I be frightened of a piece of paper?

But then it will try to attack you a second time.

We'll take its penalty, but that will be a 20 minus five so I think that still hits. You're notelling that too much that's probably like isn't it?

I mean like I will this time now that it's attacked me.

I'll use your reaction to yell so so so so um in that case I I will and then another piece of paper, this one is a frog. Jumps from somewhere um and tries to tries to bite you um and get to 19 so you take another five damage still still up I am on five isn't the one that you hit is also hurt so like okay um that's their turn then. Um Next up we have Skrin Laurie.

So I guess first I'll start with a perception because I'm kind of pretty far away like around a corner and kind of shit um I'll give it to you for free I won't take it for it but yeah yeah yeah 19 is probably fine.

So I started running.

I would have been laying on the bed so I probably get to just about like barely halfway there.

Yeah, you'll get that you'll be able to do something next time.

It'll probably take you two more actions to get in there, but you'll be able to do something next time.

Um, okay, and next up is Ou.

Okay, um I don't know what to add to an attack, to be honest.

It should be as part of it depending on what you've done, feel a character sheet, um that your proficiency is just like your level, right?

So you level con, because my thing is con, is that the only stuff that you add to like to hit something?

I think it would be like your con plus your level problem.

Okay.

Yeah, it's definitely my con.

I just don't know if what the proficiency is.

So what Ukku is going to do is he is going to first use channel elements. Which basically taps my elemental gait and then like you start seeing vines start floating into the air, sort of like growing from the ground.

And as part of channel elements, I can use a one action um elemental thing, which I will use elemental blast, um, which basically it's like a blast of wood.

But I also have weapon infusion, which allows me to, as a free action to turn it into a weapon and apply a property.

So I guess I need to first know how far away this enemy is from me. Well, there' over here.

Where are you?

I' they're like they're way over in the east like in the abometry.

I don't even know that this is happening. Would you would have heard you would have from your room, you would have heard someone, but you've got like run there from your room.

I can't remember which room you.

Yes, correct.

So maybe you in this one.

So you could probably get to about where Laurie is you want to just simplify that and say that you can basically get up to your like right by Laurie's character.

Where is Laurie's character?

Bas running down the hole, you'll get there next round and be able to do something.

Okay, I don't even know where I am on this map.

You might not be Oh, okay.

Um obviously we're podcasting so we don't want to be like talking about the map too much, uh but like basically your room and you're running down the hall trying to get to the bathroom.

I'm here.

Is that where is that where Laurie is?

Yeah, you basically right bes use move action to move into the room, right?

Into next round.

You would spend all this round running to get to whereers, running from your room.

Yeah.

Okay, that's fine yeah, just because you weren't together because it just happened in the dormitory.

Um, okay. Um and then Liz, where did you what could you pick?

I took the room opposite um the block that screen um is residing in, like on the opposite side of the hall but still right next to um Paul's character who's yeah, I kind of one off to the side.

The other three stay together.

So I think with your way you run, you'd actually be able to get to get in there.

I've only got 25 feet.

How how big are these squares?

Are they five feet?

I think you bet you can basically just get in there.

Like with full sprints, you can just get into the bath and see what's going down, but you can't do anything else.

All right, well, I will okay, thank you. Um and I'll do that perception check as well that you mentioned.

You are close enough that you would just heard it. And I see my roomy being attacked by paper. . I said my room.

I see my roomy. . Call me her roomy I' wearing separateorm rooms.

No one's ever done that before. . Oh that's always the first um but yeah I can't do anything much more this turn so um I'm done.

Yeah that' But you guys will all be able to help fully next time and you go straight back up to Paul.

You have a slightly injured paper lizard and a not injured paper frog attacking let me in knowledge is a thing that I have to do that takes an action, right?

So we're not going to take that action.

We're not going to think about what's attacking me.

Can I uh teleetic projectile at um the one that's above me.

The one that you already heard?

Yeah, yeah yeah use it to basically throw the um the towel that I picked up um back at it.

I think you are technically still grabbing onto this thing. But yeah, you can basically attack it with the telephoneony project, yeah.

Do you take a penalty because it's ranged?

Don't say anything.

I think that'll be a part-finder thing which should I should notice.

Well, I got sticks to hit, which I have seen but maybe it doesn't five damage.

It's not looking good. And I will use my last action to go away.

So I believe I can go on two three. Yes, they do not have an opportunity attack opportunity attack attacks are relatively they' I wouldn't say rare infinder, but it's ubiquitous I think I'm the only one that might get one member' .d ways to into it if you really wanted to get it, but it's everyone gets it was that impression that I't have done that in the generally speaking if it'sed something that you can generally get it's too bad.

Yeah, is just a farmer, so he does not have that. , but presumably, because you you've gone through it.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Um, Cool.

So, um, that was your turn.

On their turn, um, the lizard is gonna scamper over and hiss at Liz and then make a bite and get a 16 to hit. Let me give me a sec.

It misses.

Okay, um and it's going to try to attack again, um and that will definitely miss because I rolled only seven and the penalty. Frog is going to um hustle over towards you and also make two attacks.

That is going to miss within an eleven total, and this one is a six total, so they both miss.

Fair enough. Yeah, um that is the end of their turn.

Next up we have uh Laurie.

Yes, and I did realize just then I'd probably move further than I should have because I am slower than 30.

I forgot about that but I do have something that lets me dash a bit so I cast warp step which pops my speed by five and lets me dash twice so that would put me up to them. Um and then I'll I'll get in the middle of them and just say run back if you need to and does my last action I cast shield sounds good.

Okay.

So, um the moment the fight is basically happening in the doorway, um with uhinnick running out with a bunch of scratches, um bleeding, like not functionally bleeding, but you see a lot of blood. Um and um and Leanna is to hold them off in the doorway.

You can sort of just see her moving around.

I can get to the doorway without with one move, right?

Um What's your speed?

Probably only 25.

Yeah, normal 25 I think it would take two movements to get to them.

Well, what if I just move there?

Um.

Yeah, you can move to within like yeah, you can move to within to see them within with only one movement.

Just remember that we are podcasting so like you think what do I move there isn't good for a podcast. . I moved to the edge of the door um and that only requires one movement.

So I will do what I was going to do last round, but couldn't because I was moving.

Channel elements, uh vines start to grow from the ground.

I use that same action to do an elemental blast. Um and I am going to is um the um creature behind what's her name?

What's the , um that is behind her.

That's in within 20 feet, right?

Feet away.

Okay, so um Ray and 20 feet, so it becomes a dagger, so a wooden dagger gets thrown at um the person at the at the creature at the same time as I channel my powers.

That's the injured lizard, correct?

And because it is the throne tray, I believe I get my full strength modifier for that. Um Well, 16 plus my level, which is one plus okay go um and then I believe it will be piercing damage um and what is the blast?

It's one six, I believe for wood yeah no, 18 sorry.

It seems like a low damage.

Is that?

It is plus one, which is three.

So I do three piercing damage to the creature.

Yeah, so that is that one action or two?

That's one action.

Okay, so you have one action that.

Yeah, um I don't think I'm gonna armor up, so you see hardwood armor like basically um consume my body.

Yeah, cool.

It's funny to knowing like no one's done a knowledge check to see what these things are.

It's been okay, you know It's not not always important.

I didn't have enough running uh okay, so that would Uku. Um and then it is Leanna.

I'm going to pull my jacket out of my pocket and I'm going to try and attack the frog that tried to have a go at me before. And let's see if I'm successful.

Let's see if you are.m sorry um there's a 24 hit.

It's level one combat one hits.

Oh I can always hope um I will not be the case once you're in later levels because Parfinder gets wacky but yeah, and that will be damage isn't turning up on here so I'll just try it again one day four and I get one damage on the frog uh on the paper frog one damage.

Yeah, no, there's no modifier.

It's just the one day full damage for a dagger. Both the only one that'll get modifiers I'm a rangeatant, not a not normally a one.

You have two more actions if you would like to use them.

I'm going to try and hit it again. So you take a minus five penalty every time you try to attack a second time.

Okay.

Remember recall actions or recall knowledge is always a good thing to do, especially if you get an in-based character.

Actually, I think I'll give that a go when it hurt but then I won't be able to tell the others.

Knowledge of Arkana would probably be the best.

Do you have knowledge of Arkana?

I have academ give you.

Okay so that one 6+713. You know you this is a spell sky a spellin um basically just like scraps of fabric and v paper that become magical little constructs.

You don't really know much other than that because you didn't roll very well.

It's better than I expected. Um No, but fair enough.

At least I've got like a bit of an understanding of what the what I'm dealing with here. And I think that's my turn done. Attacks and the thing did you make a second attack?

No, I decided to do academia checks see what these Oh, okay.

One more action.

So let's try and hit this little bugger again. Is So yeah, multi attacking pathinder, you take a minus five penalty every time.

Yeah, no, that's cool yeah, I just didn't realize oh yeah, it's the plus five for the hit and then you minus the five so it's all good. Under it nine times out of it's usually not worth doing a multi Most of the time unless it's something really easy to hit better than others less of a pen these things don't seem like they' super tanky, so I feel like they're most of the way gone already so I'm not going to do something for the long term so what I'm going to do is cost electric arc.

I'm targeting most of the um paper things things, um, which is a reflex save.

Yeah.

What is your DC?

What is my DC?

It's a great question.

What's this go?

Probably first one passes on first one f second one passes I did that was the second one is the most one so roll your damage. Damage the lizard is very badly hurt and the frog doesn't look good. Okay so that was your turn.

It is now do for the story as the thing that that is maybe helpful to make us die but we're I'm going toall knowledge about this right now. Would be best I would say.

In a sense, hope that I, but we will we will run how it works.

Let me see.

Let's roll on the plus zero for that inception diplacy, intimid add on here.

Anyway, that I have the dubious knowledge feat, which means that I should get the correct answer and an incorrect answer that I don't know what's.

So I know something, but it is like a phone either the rightety or the wrong idea.

That's that's an awesome and shit feed at the same time.

So okay.

I told you about this beforehand.

I have to think I can'tan this stuff. Uh so you think that you think that it's actually alive and it's and it's like a but it's a shape shifter or no, it' just like you think it's a lie.

You think it's a live thing you don't think it's a construct think no but I've got I learn two things.

So the basic idea is I've got um d know is like I've been gossiping with people, but I've got multiple ideas about what what it is.

So I get the true answer and an erroneous answer.

So one of those is one is it's like it's an animal or some sort of beast or monstrosity or something it's a shifter Or it's shift a shap shifter so one of those is false and one of them is true.

So it's either so I've heard, let me do this for recording.

So what I what I've heard is that it's I've I've heard that it's a it's a living creature, but maybe it's also a shapeshifter I'm not so rich. It is there what I think. Nice. Uh hey it is their turn. Um the lizard um um it will again do its visit frill and try to bite Liz. Um I guess then that one, um at which point it will tire you to run away.

Do you have an opportunity yet, Laurie?

It doesn't get away fully, though.

It's just started to run away.

The lized that's buddy run away in the frog, um and is going to still try to bite Liz um and after 12 and then it will hop away towards the water. And that is their turn. Um and then we move to Skrin. That make sense, but you ruined my turn all the shit I'm going to just go after the frog cause I mean why not and then I'm going to I know we could probably let them go but I really want to try to attack something . So I'm going to try to oh I'm going to use um oh what's it called spellstack so I'll do an attack role 14.

Sorry I should probably announce which spell I'm doing it with before I do anything.

So I'm doing a spell strike with um gouging claw.

Okay.

And so 14 doesn't unfortunately okay that's a mess um then that's me that's two actions. uck up is Uku.

Ah, yes, uh Ukku will so each of these squares is uh 10 feet, right?

It's five.

Oh, okay.

And so diagnals are five as well or not?

Rule, so every second one is t 10.

Oh, every second one is tense.

The first one is five.

Yeah.

The one, two, three, four.

Yep so you run up to the frog that Laurie's going for?

Yep.

And then I am going to attempt to whack it.

That hits, I think.

You've got 17 on the dice..

Okay.

So I will roll 18.

Oh, crap, I also bad one. Uh, so two. Two damage.

Yep.

A makes my second attack a little less less likely to hit, right?

I'm not sure about you mean?

Yes correct yeah yeah it's minus four instead of five.

Okay so um my weapon created from my elemental energies is agile.

Well I can I can apply traits to it so it's agile.

I'm gonna take another whack at it. Uh so um four plus so six 17, 174 is 13.

Okay. Not too far off, but it will not hit.fortunately.

That's fine. Um okay. Uh then we move to Leanna.

I'm going to try and get the rack construct.

I'm going to throw my dagger at it.

There's no rat there's a lizard and a frog. . Oh no, sorry.

The the paper.

Oh yeah it's yeah Leanne is having a moment.

It's the first day and she's a little stressed.

So throw the d at the paper construct that isn't the frog and as a 17 hit. Fantastic.

And then I will see if I can cause some damage for it.

Oh, that didn't work.

I don't need to because it's one hip point left.

It dies.

Fantastic.

Give me a perception check, though.

Oh, perception check.

That's plus five.

So 12 plus five, 17.

You see a tiny little scrap of paper that got torn off by your strike um runway from the from it.

Interesting. Um okay um and that was your first action.

My next thing I' is I'm gonna go into the room and collect my dagger. Pick up and then that's.

Okay. Um this turn probably pretty similar to the last one um but I will finally at the exact right moment to do it um and not a terrible moment to do it I will cost uh kate theanthm um which going forward will give um everyone a plus one statusonus to attack rolls damage rolls and saves against spear. Um so I'll just um infuse with my magic to hear the words hey we're halfway down.

There's just one of these dudes left.

We've got this guys. Um and then I will cost electric arc again.

So we save again anything now or let me check what that did.

I succeed, but I still take half damage. Succeed.

There's a basic reflex save.

I've I rolled eight, which means you take four it takes four, but so I sit the electric arc out the remaining frog for four damage. Uh yeah. Um cool.

So um on its turn after you, um it moves runs away um runs away and attemptss to hide and getting pretty good role.

So you you may get sort of darts into a crack and get like disappears, you you'll have to try to see if you can find it.

Okay, um next up is Skri.

So did this has this commotion brought anyone else over or are we like the only ones?

They probably I say at this point there are probably a few people who are looking around like what's going on. Running in there.

I don't think it's much of a dangerous to us at the moment so I' probably approach the door and just poke my head out and go there's some weird animal in here.

Should we care about these?

Let's say the is there and she says, oh probably probably not.

That's weird.

I wonder what that could be of.

Huh.

Um, probably not a big deal. Then like pointed um not not a big deal um felt like a pretty big deal to me.

What did you find them?

In the in the never under the the towels.

Well, that that piles of aandoned laundry.

Yeah, I think someone needed to tidy up.

I don't know.

I didn't know they were there, then maybe maybe if they they they probably just didn't recognize you or if they were there, they they weren't threat for us unless they just got the here.

Well, God knows how long that laundry has been left there.

It's been piling up a little bit.

Yeah.

Do you need some healing?

I would appreciate it.

Um, let me see whether SE can heal.

We got to check uh a different section of the an apple like it unlimited Apple recentlyource Yeah, pretty much uh Uku can make as many apples as he wants.

I accept the apple and I thank you thank you for the apple here we go.

Let's roll the D four.

Let's do it on here.

I can give you 10 minutes because it doesn't use it's not useful after 10 minutes. It's not useful within the 10 minutes to give.

Well I'm back up on nine ? Yeah.

Oh, okay well cool.

I think it' best if everyone just gets a good rest tonight and make sure you're well prepared for your trials tomorrow.

I hope they don't mind the smell.

I'm not going to be to be bathing tonight.

When I go to pick up my dagger, I see the dirty and I see a pair of daddy dundies and I say to everyone, I'm going to be using the bathroom to freshen up for now on. In like wooden plate mail wooden plate is going to get into the bath, but he's like a fully armed armed person.

I mean look, I don't want to deal with the laundry either, but if any of you wants to deal with that laundry, it would be doing this all the favor.

I don't with me I'm happy to let it laugh.

Well, I go to go to use other washer and wash my face and patty up and go back to my dawn room and get to bed and get to start on on the child for tomorrow.

Yeah, and I just retire back to my room and go to bed immediately.

Okay.

You all retire?

Well, I actually haven't heard from what is screen do.

Oh yeah, he would have just been walking back to his room already threats over.

I'm not gonna go wash up.

I'm fine.

You rat rats oh wait, I'm not gonna say that that's being sexist about rats.

Go racist about rats.

Sorry. So you guys all to bed and you wake up the next morning and you basically been told to meet at the front you meet like somebody outside um and in the morning uh you see Hey um uh who calls that ah, the green shoots blossom in the rain. Um the well muscled and clean shaven dwarf man calls out with a smile. Uh he gives a friendly wave as um coming out um um SE is coming out and says uh it was meant to be me and Root meaning you uh but uh guess not. Um Sie says, I swapped with anchor Root um brushing the point aside. For addressing the new students uh over the next five days you'll be helping as we said, you'll be helping each of the school's fire branches.

Abraham and Anchor root seek to join the rain scribes, which is the branch that explores the world and helps other travelers make their way through uncertain territories.

That means rain scribes have to work well with both nature and people.

Heyraham continues we can lose your help.

The Kaisi market won't deal with anyone they know is part of the Mambia, so since you are new, you should be able to get in without a problem, you'll be looking for ah chickens.

Did you know there's such a thing as endangered chickens?

Of course any chicken that comes too close to me is endangeredram grins a farmer outside of Ned taboo. To solo said her family used to keep O Ojafir chickens said they could catch anything, even a dragon's egg.

I don't know about that, but she wants to reach Oafirries again so we're going to get us some.

Ojafuri eggs aren't very hardy and the bergs aren't very good legs and they mostly got put in soup and now there's hardly any left, what we caught wind that some at cafesiafisi market has a few chicks go and bring back some. Right and bring back these fury chicken eggs?

Yeah, chicks or eggs or eggs.

Yeah, hard to find can be a bit fragile sometimes.

How's the soup?

I wouldn't know personally. As he says, yeah, the soup is irrelevant. Uh We'll need four, uh four twos. Will hopefully ensure that we have at least one male and one female.

The more the better though as many as you can get. Um I've got 20 gold that I can give you to me that should be more than enough. But you'll have to go find theafi which is a wandering bazaar. Um you'll have to find where it is we' not 100% percent sure where it is today and then you'll have to find the seller.

Right.

And how do we identifying how do we know we're not just getting a normal chick?

That is a af chickens, they' small fowl with white faces, dark blue feathers and lavender combs.

The chicks should have dark blue feathers with a white underbelly . Be careful at the market.

Some of those sellers uh will sell you your mum if they could so don't trust don't trust everyone.

I mean if my mom was for sale, I'd want to buy your back. That that's it'v it'svant don't put ideas into their minds.

Just go get the chicks. Has told us if I pay.

Hey, it's all right.

I won't let him buy anyone's mothers. Any more questions?

No. Fine market find bender get chickens come back..

We'll see you at dinner then.

Yes. We'll see you at dinner. Or before if you can get back in back earlier.

Okay.

See you then.

All right, so trial one has begun.

What would you how do you go?

How would you want to do?

How do you want to go about it?

Anyone know what town is town is just off to the side yeah you know what town is you just don't know where the market is specifically.

I guess I mean the first thing for us to do is it's not particularly interesting, but we should probably all recall whether we know these things. Um so I will it's a moving the market moves from different market moves.

You got to figure out where it is today.

What heckar.

Could I do a recall knowledge to see if I would know anything about the routine of the of the traveling farm farmyard? . Yeah, I would give you a bonus like like there are locations you could check Okay.

So I'll just do a typical law check.

I don't was talking to you I'm saying you'amboo, so like you're you don't really have you're really sure.

Well, in that case, uh my N has given me a role of 18.

You know like dozen locations like to be if you were to just start walking to one, you get lucky there's one not too far away like half an hour away and it might be there, but if you would have walked to all of them, it would take you four or five six hours. Right is this market quite large?

It's large a aantage point could we spot it?

Um there be a bit tricky like maybe Well, do you think any of the other students might know where this is today?

This market is I mean we can ask anyone we see on the way yeah okay so if you're just gonna start walking um around uh heading out of the Mambia campus out into um theantambu. Um and you're just going to ask someone.

What do you you just see someone on the street?

Yeah, I'll be yeah, I'll be first person I say, I'll just be like hey, you know who the market yeah, all right give me a give me a diplimacy check. Uh no, sorry.

I go I'm both to work. Um and they camper off.

Um, you were lucky to get that, actually.

Um would anyone else like to try?

And is anyone else just looking around?

Let's see is there some way where people would be gathering aside from maybe the dining hall?

Um, not necessarily.

Um, like like like it there's not like full classes in session right now that you're aware of. Doesn't happen to be a newspaper that the town puts out, is there?

You're you don't think so.

You haven't heard a one. Um hey would anyone else like to try a diplomacy check?

I mean I'd like to head over to the dining hall perhaps to find someone um who's around uh and have a look at the dining hall and read the air to see if I can figure out someone who looks like they would have experience with this sort of thing. A read the air with a spell. ? Yeah.

Okay. Um I will read it to you. Um you take a deep breath as you survey a social situation um starting co you all around the intuition swiftly picks up clues about social context among the broken assumptions of behavior. Blah, blah, blah, blah, you as part of tossing this action, you can recall acknowledge using society to gain information about the immediate social situation.

You also gain a plus one status bonus on your next diplomacy check to make an impression on those creatures when you cast the spell so long as the check occurs within the next minute. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Okay. So you need to do a society check.

Yes, I will recall a societyledge society.

Here we go.

I got a seventeen for that society check.

Okay. Um yeah, you see there's um there's a couple of people doing deliveries into the dining hall.

I at the back. Right.

Well, I will walk over to them and let's I will stop talking right now so that I can say something.

I' coherent when I figure out the exact phrasing that this is supposed to go with.

Oh, you got any of them chickens?

All right. Um so I I'll go over to them um and I'm gonna say hey you guys look really busy.

Do you know what would be great?

I think what would make your day is if I was to give you a bit of a soundtrack while you're working. Um and that's why I'm going to use performance to make an impression on them because that's what buds do.

Okay.

So.

I bring out my loot and give him a little soundtrack, um and that gives a performance of 20 which I can use to make an impression um on them.

And then I'll after I do that based on however they're feeling, you.

Right on a little dude, that's a good groupoove.

What was your name again?

Ah, my name is Finn..

I love the groove.

Oh, thanks. Um You know, I I love it right here, but I was thinking I was really looking for some supplies myself uh for the full school year.

And I heard that there was like a market going on around here.

Do you know anything about where I would find?

I think you called the kiki markets?

The market, the market.

Where's the market today?

I it's west somewhere west.

I know that much.

I can't remember how far up west it would go exactly it is, but it's definitely go w head west and you'll find it out there somewhere.

All right. Head west. It's it's close enough that we would see it within the day, right?

Uh yeah. Yeah.

Like you'll get there.

I just I'm not exactly I can't remember where west. Uh um, but it's in one of the western spots.

Wow.

Thank you.

Thank you so much for your assistance and you're doing a great job there.

And with that I will head back to their other people are.

So you know it would take you about half an hour to get to like far west to the city, like and then like an hour to get like to basically the full at the very western edge of the of N Nantamboo.

Yep. Um so that gives you a direction to go out there. Um it is raining pretty bad today.

How dare it be?

It's just water.

Yeah, so I'll gather up with the other people and let them know what just had occurred there, um if we want to go west, um or if we want to try and figure out some more information beforehand, um what do you guys think?

Well, from the other spot do you remember, like are they kind of set out like almost like a clock suppose you could save the 12?

Sometimes it's a bit more inside, you know, but you normally it is more more of the outskirts so like there are like three or four spots you could you you're sure it's one of those three or four yeah, so I guess I tell them that but like the I don't know exactly where it is, but it's it's one of these few um shouldn't take too long to check each of them. And maybe we get lucky.

I'm pretty keen to check out the city no matter, so I'm happy to just go for one and see how we go.

All right then if there's no objections, then let's go west.

Ed it's peaceful there.

Great, you start heading west at a decent little piece. Um and yeah, so give me a perception check unless you're gonna ask more people stuff.

I saw how awesomely social I am before.

I'm just going to looking around for shit.

I'll I'll do a reception right now. . I'll have a another um ask around as we walk um for the with the inquiry in mind so plus five to that. Um, okay.

So with your temception, like your sort of you head to one of the locations of the markets and like, it's not this one. Um Liz, you find someone um and you start talking to them.

What do you say?

We're looking for some chickens um with a blue chickens.

What kind of chickens you?

I got chickens, just normal chickens.

I can you chickens.

What do you need?

More of a blue breasted chicken. Breasted chicken kind of chicken you talking about?

I don't know about these chickens.

I haven't had many encounters with them, but um we need to get 20 of them. Need chickens.

That's a lot of chickens give that Well, um do you know someone who could get us a number of chickens?

Look the best the best person I know for rare chickens is someone called Main them in the market the markets.

They're just over there.

They're about about just another half hour walk that way, uh a bit north.

Thank you thank you so kindly.

I had him an apple.

Just asking for another time of chicken, you wouldn't know any good crispy varieties. Crispy I got some good fried chicken if that's what you looking for.

I mostly do with the chicken. pieces. 's , I got lunch.

Let's go find the other chickens.

Yes let's go. So you guys head over you spent about 15 minutesaffing about around the dining hall half an hour getting into this location another half hour so you spent about an hour and 15 minutes um um maybe an hour and a half by the time that you find uh McKain went to a point you have a name because you found someone who happened to know about this particular chicken salesperson.

Yes.

Okay.

So if we found the M MK E. Um and you see a uh stern faced looking woman, uh shaved bald head, huge hoop earrings through her ears as she says, uh what you looking for?

Are you looking for chickens?

Up here.

Oh, you go.

I think you're more charming than me.

Well, I then I say well, yeah, we are looking for some chickens and I've heard that you've got some of the best in the lances.

So I think I'm speaking to the right person you talking about the right person?

Just one second, I just got to a deal with this customer.

They walk up around the customer and you want chickens?

I hands to a customer. Okay.

I mean at that point I'm like, do I I see that there's the of fury chickens?

You look around and she seems to have six chickens that look look like the match of the description you were given.

Okay.

Well, um noticing that I I guess I just say Yeah, I'm looking for those those Oaf are those the Ojafuri chickens back there?

Ah Good eye, my friend good eye. Uh yes, I am the only one in town that you'll find selling them today.

I have six left. Six left well what would it take for you to part with this?

Four gold each friend gold each Well, we have 20 gold.

They'll get you five and I'll have one w um I I forget the exact way to do this in this mechanism but I will try to persuade um it's this diplacy, not persuading, but I will ask I will make a request or a bulk discount I will ask hey, like if if I if we take theole off your hands, you're you're going to have the whole rest of your day to be focusing on you know, seeing the s sites all of those things.

So maybe maybe if we give you the 20 gold, you could give a six.

What do you think?

Yeah, give me a diplomacy check.

Yeah, yeah. Well, um I may have rolled in that too, but that that becomes a nine.

I rolled in nine.

I can't really b I can't really move from the four, sorry. Um no.

It's going to be four gold each, I think. Um But look, you've only got 20 gold.

I see another customer over here, um and he usually likes to take an ogophury when I have them.

So there'll only be five left in a second anyway.

Could I assist um in trying to obtain all of these chickens that we need?

Well, does anyone have mercantile law?

I'll just a several times throughout this book to like encourage you guys to come up with alternative solutions.

So give me a farming roll. , can you do the role?

I'm just away from my computer right now.

Ah, sure.

What do I get on the dice?

I get a What's your do you know?

I like intelligence plus proficiency.

I think it's plus three or plus four basically.

Okay, like 17.

Okay, so that's that I will say that that's a success.

What do you say?

That one is a I suppose it's a bit of a 20 gold, you say. 20 gold.

Oh, right.

All right, 20 gold, I'll give you I'll give you all six.

To be honest I was gonna yeah, I can spare that.

I think like my customer can can can deal with that for a day.

And next time I get a b to three years old, give him a good price.

Okay.

I'm sure you. 20 gold, five chicks.

Six six, six chicks.

Nice try.

Would there be anything else?

What's the best way to carry six chickens?

Is anyone here trained in nature?

Yes, you are trained in.

I am trained in trained.

So you you look them up and like look at these baby chicks and you notice question they need to be kept on you had a long wet walk here and I hear that there sounds as conversations so can I do a recall knowledge under nature to command the chicks to stay close to my chest so they can keep warm so they don't get wet? . It's not really how nature works.

Sure give me a check.

Hopefully I decent assisting on I ask like since I can hear animals are they say in anything of interest to this warm this is warm with the 19 with a 24 check he's like yeah okay um you like snuggle them up like into your jacket and they sort of quiet down.

It's a bit precarious with six chicks in your in your coat, but you can manage it.

Oh.

Go for the team.

Yeah, um so you have the six chicks, it's taking you about two hours um to do to achieve this. Um Anything else you want to do you're at the market is there are quite a few shops here. Um there's a lot of items available. Um Does anyone go shopping or do you guys just I'd like to go shopping but I'm carrying six chicks.

I don't know if I can carry anything else.

I think it would probably be best if we head back but I mean if we've got free time and the rest of the day, it might be fun to come back here yeah. Uh yeah, um says yeah, I would I would get them somewhere warm as quick as you can to be honest uh and then we'll be here for the next at least six hours. If they start complaining about the cold, let me know make a that I guess I say well thank you Nick McKen um hopefully we can do this again sometime. Of course I'll be here or or one of the other 12 locations of this market.

It keeps things interesting.

It's that it's it like a p sorry this you just reminded is there like a pattern to that or are we just supposed to be like how so you guys just turn up?

Kind of it kind of varies based on like sporting events and other big events, tax days, uh various things uh is it down Sometimes sometimes it's not How do you know where it is I get up really early in the morning I just leave her at all Anyway best get them to We're just not cool enough to know where the markets go . Maybe we should make our own markets.

Yeah we' better markets , do you want to own the better markets?

I like it here.

It keeps things interesting I said yeah maybe maybe tomorrow we'll have the better markets here.

But it's it's just an idea it's just an idea we'll we'll we'll reroup on this.

But thank you thank you thank you.

I thank meenna for the um in regards to the transaction and I encourage our farmer friend to leave an apple.

I do.

I give her an apple. Thanks. Get back to me chickens and we geese. Apple.

I'm sure it is. Apple day as they say.

Indeed.

Well, let's head east then.

Yeah, it takes you uh just like now that you know where to go, it's only a half hour walk to get back um all in all it's taking you a bit under three hours since getting the tus and you arrive back to the Mambia campus with six healthy Ojafiri chickens. Um and you eventually you would find uh Heybram says, oh, you're back early uh do you you had a successful day there or you need some directions?

We'vechieved.

It'd be good if you gave us directions where to put the chickens. Yeah um I think uh we'll we'll take them over to um we'll we'll put them over here for now giving some warm uh just somewhere inaging.

We'll get anchor route to come have a look and make sure they are the real deal.

Otherwise you'll have to go get go back, get some get the role proper ones.

Uh Anchorout, where are you?

Um and you see a um a small uh dog like they are why don't you give me a nature check?

What's the side?

I think we said among the better this are an ant knoll.

They are three feet tall. Um they resemble an an odd wolf. Um remember remember remember like sort of like a friendly looking wolf kind of thing um and this is oh, hello hello there. Uh you're the new student?

Hi, I'm I'm Anchor root. Did you get the?

Yes, we did.

Well, we hope so.

There's a few that look a little bit like uh um orury, but I'm sure I'm sure you got the right thing.

Can I see them?

I open up my cloak and then you see all six chickens. , you did well.

You very well keeping.

That's I see one, two, three, four, five six.

Oh you did a very good job.

I'll I'll I'll make I'll make sure that I keep them warm until we get them delivered.

How much he bundles them up, um and scampers off with all six chicks.

Oh, I guess that's complete.

Yeah.

Yeah, you up around, do whatever today?

Yeah, I don't have anything else for the rest of the day. Feel free to take the spare time as you like.

You don't need us to pick you up anything from the markets?

I'm I'm fine.

You can be welcome to ask the other students around if you want to see if anyone needs anything or maybe someone else wants to go with you, but for right now I'm good.

Well then, let's head back to the markets.

Yeah, if I see if not anyone I recognized from like our introductions and stuff, I'll ask them, but probably not anyone new.

Yeah. Look, I think we'll call it there.

We'll call the episode there. Um yeah, I feel like that was a pretty long one in the ground scheme, so we got a bit covered.

Yeah.

Cool.

I think we'll just do the one for tonight.

We're still well progressed. Um I don't think if we' record a second one, we're gonna be here pretty late.

I don't want to do that to people.

Yeah, my heart drive is in the middle of dying, so I've kind of uned and not using it so it should be fine.

Like it still boots up, but it just stops working after about like a few hours, so I've not using it until I get another hard drive to copy the shit off because that's what all the backups and shit of the other stuff. Yeah.

So that include the last episode because I didn't up that I real I end uploading.

Yeah.

Um, yeah, hopefully you enjoyed all that. Um I'm glad we did get to a little combat. Uh that combat could have happened last session, um but like I was trying to think of a like do you go to?

Yeah, I had a feeling that was that there we could have had a I knowledge beforehand either to know what it is or to justify why I didn't care um beforehand as opposed to retroactively.

But gotta remember what you can do in this game.

Yeah. Uh just to know, I think it' be a good idea if people make sure that they read out what they roll.

Yes.

I did notice a few people forgot to do that.

I mean it's I think Phil ended up realizing that and saying what they rolled, but yeah just make sure you what we have to be care battle map great.

I'm happy to use the battle map, but we can't refer to the battle map, but we got to describe what we're doing. Otherwise it's it's a tough one.

I don't know.

I think we probably I'll probably try to avoid battle maps most of the time because I don't think they enhance what we're doing.

But it does simplify.

I don't know, I honestly think it does enhance what we're doing, but we just sort of be yeah, just because of how picky positioning can be in these kind of games. That we just have to be on top of saying like look instead of just going I move here, it's like, oh, I move past the the door and go next to the chair in the middle of the room and do this. The cool thing regardless of whether there's a map or not is to give a clear description of what your tone is after you've decided what it is.

I think we can work together and right?

I think we can help cover each other.

And if like if you want to be like, oh, like if you think there's a cool thing you can help enhance what they're doing, do it.

I think that's cool.

We can support each other.

Yeah.

I'm I haven't those chickens, but you chose not to doesn't chickens just throws around.s chickens?

Is that there was no real you talking about it.

I'mrispy chicken I like not even spells but like actions basically dip checks to insult people to weaken themselves for for the command animal, I think it's fine what we use it for, but I don't think that's what it's intended for.

Commanding an animal, I think that's more to do with like riding a horse or it's kind of like she rolled really good on that and then it was a combination of well, literally is talking to them with.

And that's the thing do, right?

They just talk a small animal.

Not all of them, but a lot of them. A small animal are you get ailiar at some point Paul?

I think so, maybe.

I haven't. Thought about it that far ahead.

Not a thing.

I am actually tempted to get a rap familiar.

Well, I was at the start that I ended up going something different.

You could get a turtle turtle.

But hopefully you enjoyed that I feel like there's moments where we could roleplay a bit more.

I'm still figuring out who these characters are a little bit like and there's a lot of MPCs and like probably already fucked up a little bit of them, but like whatever they'll be our versions of them.

I mean I' back to what, but yeah this commanded animal I like as written, it feels very easy to command that animal.

Like it says most animals know drop their own leaks leap seek, stand stride and strike.

I'm like why would you be able to do that with most animals?

Well it also like different animal activities such as the horses gallop you can command the animal anyway.

But that was specifically a thing where it just said like you just these things are gonna like if you don't do the nature check, one or two of these things are gonna die.

But then you got a 24 check so it wasn't necessarily you knew that they needed to be you knew they needed to be careful and you were able to do and then I think no matter what people have been I was almost just gonna dump out whatever I had in my bag and just put them in there.

Yeah, I was going to do basically the same thing Liz he was doing but I was just going to be like I have a animal elocutionist so I can speak to them but ask the right questions like that was like that was the second part of the test.

It was sort of like three parts of that test.

Find the market, find the seller, get them at a good price, get them home safe.

You did the find the market you did in a different way.

Basically they were like diplomacy or perception check and you were like . Iered the DC a little bit because you got it and it was supposed to be in DC 19 and you got 17 society and I was like, I' this like they're not give you exactly where it is give you ? Yeah, which you the name which may have been like I probably could have made that but like either like you thatenge like you kind of that you were on a basically was selling one that's why when you got there I was like oh yeah she sells her second chick at that point she got six left. So you know that there is anyone else likeain chicken yeah yeah yeah I went near the side of trying to make that a joke but it didn't quite work um and there is like basically at this markets there is common items of level five and below so you guys could actually buy a bunch of shit but you don't have a lot of money is we got like 45 yeah I wasted three silver and chickens.

I like no one even like considered. Using their own money. Can I mean there was be okay putting the the last one there was a way to get them down to two gold per chick but there was also a way for them to five gold per chick one person that could have dip dip.

Whats do people have so we got a farming and that I was like well remember we've got a farming law.

That's not mercantile law, but that's like I'm like I'mge something a little bit here and I gave you an extra chick in that you getting, which I'm the book encourages and I want to encourage?

So it's, I'm not going to give you as much as you would get with mercantile and you kind of just didn't make that last chance I give you something I'm not give you as much as I could doing well all theseenges, like a very balanced , I've a local terrain I guess jungle.

I haven't actually written that in properly and ratolk.

So I've got pretty general kind of crap with not too much. Recommend having someone having that and it makes sense in the context I think I might have and said I hadom at one point instead of didn't change too much.

And then Liz has general academia, which is like kind of interesting you to other magic schools you.

You just have farming or do you have other ones?

No, just farming right now.

Most people just have one, having more than one is not common in minded.

I will have the mess of having everything sort of but all the time.

I'll have all the specific f laws failed them all the time and force uh failed to give me two answers.

That's the build.

Sometimes it's going well, it's like I'm happy to improv that, right?

Like sometimes it's going to be good and worthwhile and sometimes it's going to be like fuck I's gotta come up with two things and get through this. And so be it like like today and that was kind of a today one.

I was like, okay, well, you know you someone else knows that they' only a, but you don't.

So I'm saying you think there's actually an actual creature that's not a construct and they're shap shifter and now you you probably as a player knew that okay, well they're shapeshifters my perspective, if I was given that exact thing, I would have done the false one being like a reason why I was not caring about like like that there was something good that I should be opening up. Because I't not like committed to that.

I was like, oh, they're like, I don't know.

They're like raffle tickets.

If you collect them, you get a price from the from your teacher is that like a thing?

Yes.

I reckon this is a bit but if you only just, give like one fairly useful bit and one fairly detrimental thing, like they're vulnerable vulnerable to fire and lightning, only one of them. , if you critical, you don't get the other one, you just get wrong.

I think that would be an evolving thing to like, sometimes be very good and sometimes a good plot device though in general remember doing what's the recall knowledge is a good idea.
