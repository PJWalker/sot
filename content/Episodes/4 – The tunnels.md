# Raw Transcript

Laura, you're good to go Liz you're good to go remember you're mute are you good to go?

To say the thing before you take the mute off.

I mean after you take the mute off.

Have we lost a we got technical difficulties with . He unmuted at a opportune time, which makes me think we haven't lost him, but maybe there we go we can hear you to go?

Yeah and Paul has been talking and Gemma I said, so I figure you two are good to go.

Yep.

Cool.

So yeah, I'll improv a little introduction to the Gemma, noting that we've done in a pre-recorded intro for her and her character and it will sound something like this.

Yeah, so . Welcome back Gemma Sinclair to the podcast.

She wasn't able to join us for the first few episodes, unfortunately, um due to her own scheduling and things but she's joininging us now and we introduce her in all due haste.

Welcome Gemma. In our last episode with an afternoon of downtime for our students, so they made their way back to the market for some shopping.

Screen purchased a basic simple magical run.

Ukku bought some seeds for a gardening project, Leanna bought a fancy pussycat, andinnick bought a magical mask of a bit of an odd trader.

They met Ignasi and Senway at dinner time and got to know their fellow students a bit better.

In the morning, they were tasked with the tempest son made assignment and told to clear some gremlins out of a storeroom. On their initial knowledge check about gremlins, they learned that they had a reverence for knolls, so went to Anorout to ask for assistance, but they weren't able to convince her to help so that they then made tracks to the library to do some research and learned about their inversion to bells.

They went there and went to the powder powder pile to secure some bells from Zokan and then made their way to the storeroom.

True to their research, the Gremlins were unable, seemingly unable to attack anyone wielding these small bells, and with some old fashioned grappling, they were able to drag and chase the gremlins off the campus.

During the melee, they did notice a trap door in the storeroom and this is where we will jump in.

So you guys have just finished clearing the Gremlins out of the storeroom and at some point, I think I've back on it slightly, but whatever, at some point during the fight, you noticed that there was a trap door that they tried to run away in, but you will say that you dragged them out of there because you wanted to taste them fully off campus and that is what happened.

Yeah.

I was a fairly large trap door like five by five.

Probably more like three by three, so large, like large enough. But yeah looking at the others who check this out I mean we got to see where they eat how they got in here we got to check it up.

Well then let's go ahead and go down. Yeah you can open it up and start heading down into the tunnels.

It doesn't take you too long to get down there. So um it takes you like it's probably like 20 feet down um and then you get down to some tunnels.

Why don't probably not necessary right now.

You basically look and you like open alcove and you go and then you can either turn right or you can turn left um but yeah, depends how you want to start exploring this place.

I'm not much one for splitting up.

I think we let's always go left.

I'm making my decision.

We're going left.

Left it is so who's leading and can you all see in the dark?

I do have no light vis.

I think I do.

I'm just checking, but it the way I said that it sounds like I'm leading, so I will lead.

Yeah, Ioww.

I would say that there is no light down. Someone does someone have I have dark vision and I can see in dim light.

I could go up front. A light because the rest of you cannot see all.

I do have a so I just produce and light up a torch. Cause I'll have that in one hand and then the other hand I've got my rapier yeah yeah and with that I guess I'll let you slide in front of me.

I don't think there's a whole lot of space for us to be neearing around but stick to the edge. Is the m idea it's in the back in the back I'll.

I was in the front until I was like that and then they're all going.

I will be in the rear but I will and bring up my arm that is that just wearing?

Is that something you're not always wearing like like medium armor that I I get a you all this wooden plates form over Uku's body, including a wooden shield just forms. Like me. , you go left. Why don't you give me a screen, give me a perception check.

Okay. Pretty bad yeah, that's fair enough.

You can't understand why don't give me a survival check as well and Liz, you can give me a perception check as yours are the second in line okay. A little bit better on survival 12. This what's your perception?

But it didn't work on that because I'll just do it through the half build a website then.

Okay, so you two in the front are going through, um and quickly realize that this is like a maze of tunnels and it sort of starts to become overwhelming.

You don't get lost per se, but you don't find anything interesting, but as you're going through, um you're not since you're not able to find anything interesting, you hear from Uku, you in the back able like look at one of these paths down the right and you just don't look up and you see like a little crack of light and you think that that's another way out. These tunnels just seem to just be, well, black different routes between something or is that some sort of purpose to them, like a sewer or something?

They't seem to be a sewer, they just seem to be like hidden passageways.

Like this school, as you know, is quite old, so it might just be old, hidden passageways that like the creepy wizardudes. Or there might be something to be doing with the defense, but you're not really sure.

They they're not still with the stuff.

But Uku, do you tell you tell people that you see in a different way out?

Sorry, I spoke of you can you say what have you said again?

Yes, I do.

Well, I guess that way Yeah, if there's we got to see what's at the other end of this um dismaze.

Well, this is just one way off uh like there's tunnels and there's there's splits and there's crossroads all over the place.

This does seem to be a fairly extensive maze of tunnels. Um but as you go over to this other one, it's another 20 feet climb up this little ladder to get up um and you look up um and why don't you give me a you can you can you can all start climbing up and you can give me either it's just like an intelligence check or like survival check or I suppose Mambia law if you've got it.

What about a nature check?

Um not really okay yeah I got an 18 foria. Uh you notice it pretty quickly then um like so the first of you you start coming out and it's like it's some sort of dormitory um like the like obviously it must be something school but then you notice that this is um do you realize this is dormitory so you haven't actually gone very far uh it's basically one of these dormitories near just one of these unmarked buildings on this map on the um on the map and it's yeah so you so I noticed so I noticed that it's the star dormitory said Yes, you guys are inspire dormitory Yeah, yeah uh so I guess I let these guys know so I'll I'll say I think I think this is the star dormitory.

Maybe this maze like connects everyone together?

How big how much of a network do they have under here?

Yeah I could stretch quite far.

Maybe we should check out our our dorm and see if there's a trap door there too.

Yeah.

So maybe maybe we should go back under here.

I don't think we're supposed to be in in someone else's dormitory right now.

It's frowned upon without an invitation.

Oh, well, back to the tunnels.

Yeah, you guys can easily go back to the tunnels.

You can make your way back to the storage barn or did you want to continue trying to explore?

Well, if we're down here, it wouldn't have to have a little bit of an exploration before returning to the surface. These tunnels if we let's see if we can find the dining hole.

I want to find a dining hole.

It should be it should be in uh it should be somewhere around here, right?

Isn't the dining hall near the library?

I'd love to go to the library.

There there's several libraries in this place.

Um, there's at least three, um, as well as the archives.

I'd be happy to like peek into one that would be lovely to have a little way to get in and out.

But if you're going to try to use the tunnels to try to make it to the dining hall or something that you're familiar with, then I'm going to need someone to give me a survival check and it's not it's a bit of a tricky DC. I mean I think that was my idea so I'll do the survival check.

It's not gonna go very well but we'll do it.

I rolled a 15 for survival. ival you know basically like you sort of get your bearing storage bar, you know Magambia law, Mambia better than most so you sort of try to get your bearings that way and you start going which way you think is and you go south and you think this might be it and you find a another exit out and you exit out and you end up in what appears to be a library and since you're leading the way, why don't you give me another Mambia law?

I can't you might just know this.

Well, with a 23, I end up not 20 I probably do. Find yourself in art library and you realize that you haven't quite gone far enough, you, I mean it doesn't look like the dining hole, but I mean, let's check this place out.

It looks like the Aland library that library, , this is this is what you, right?

Wow.

I' having a little bit of a peek around and yes, they books in nearby before we have to continue on. Back like dusty part of the library, like in the back. And so you came out and you're in like a section just dedicated to sort of like old man, like technical manuals.

It's not a place that people come a lot.

Oh, I'm fascinated.

This is my heaven.

Gentlemen, you could leave me here if you want to, but I think it's best not to break up the party. C I said we continue on and find the dining hall for I was kind of look for the comics there any comics in here?

A h , but does admire the yeah, you can do that. Remember just so you know you' just a little bit fuzzy tonight.

I don't know if you're using a different thing.

It's okay.

It's just a little bit fuzzy. But we'll make sure it's the same thing I mostly use. Maybe just that sounded better.

Maybe we were a little bit closer then or something. But yeah, like the wood is nice, it's old, classic wood. Um not magical that you notice um is like magical or not. Is it yeah, there are no comic books that you find here just like textbooks Well, I guess having a look at that, I might try to go back toiana and and test her how to maybe maybe move on. Land?

The tunnels seem interesting. Um but it depends on what everyone wants to do.

I'm happy otherwise.

What is it do we know like?

I mean we' degree but midday still a little bit of time to haven't eight hours to one in about three hours I believe so yeah, but I'm I'm feeling a bit hungry so I think maybe we just go over land.

I it's kind of like.

I eat.

Yeah, well give me a sec. Um I quickly crawl down the ladder again and get out some chalk and just ride down the bottom arc Arcorn library. And then climb back up.

So we at least know where one destination goes that makes a good idea. Go to the towel.

Yep, so at the moment you've got all your gear and stuff.

Are you going straight to the dining hall or you going to the dormitory to drop stuff off first?

You like you got your bells and sort of everything like that.

Oh, true.

And some of you are a bit dirty from grappling with gremlins.

And I have to put the cat in.

I'm pretty hungry that's not a problem I didn't even that doesn't cross my mind.

I've eaten it within two. Well uh yeah I guess I guess we can go to the dos after then uh first, then then we can go eat.

Yeah, cool. Um okay, go to the dorms first.

I get to the dorms and you see um Chiziah and Ezzy are sort of hanging out in the common room, um you know, as Ignasi and Anoroo. Um um or also just sort of floating around um they said, oh, uh he said he says, oh, good to see you.

Um, who gave me the 10% of assignment?

Um how did you go?

Have you dealt with the Gremlins yet?

Yeah, we got them.

They're all gone.

Oh, excellent.

Uh, oh, you should know, uh, you have a new member of your group, your student group.

They're just in their dorm.

The name is OKyri, you should go say hello.

They were unfortunately a couple of days late, they' gone through orientation. If you hadn't finished with the Gremlins, I would have said to get them to help you, but I thought you might be done with that one already.

All right.

Yeah. Pleasure to meet the new new t student, I guess.

Um, come, I'll take you. Um and she takes you down to a room, it's the first room by like the southern exit, um and knocks on the door for you say, uh Ori, uh are you there?

There's a very quiet squawk and a bit of a thump.

Yes, I'm in here. The rest of your student group are here. Um I thought it would be good for you to meet them.

They have finished their task for the day, so free time for the rest of the day.

Of course, I will be in a moment and I will meet them.

There's a couple of other kind of bumps.

It's like somebody shifting something around and the door opens and there is a 6 foot tall woman on the other side of the door, white hair eyes that have no pupils to them.

They're just kind of blue kind of slender um but possibly the most offputting thing about her are the massive wings on her back and the talented feet that she's got.

My apologies for my tardiness, it was quite a tall tall?

Oh, sorry. Um wanted to ask to get to college.

I amory. Opens the door and then comes out, I I'm I'm looking like straight forward so I see those those um those feet like straight on.

I'm a little taken aback, so I take a step back and then I look look up and then I take another step back and then like I take a breath and I'm like, okay, and then I'm like it's me.

I'm I'm you're a Car Cory a Coryory.

And I go in for a hug, but I'm probably mostly hugging the leg if if this works. Kind of takes sort of a half step back this normal cost for your species?

Oh sorry it's it's just really nice to meet new people you know but we don't have to do anything just you do you on the back and say this is very much a pleasure to do a little bow. One one hand behind it back and gives you a very low refnt bow.

I mean, I'm still probably shorter than your bow.

I' quite a small rat folk white rat folk that you would see.

You are unusual.

I mean the usual around my family, but I get you.

Certainly one of the few non humanoid looking people that I have seen around here.

Yeah, well we're a bit of a ragtag group looking around at the rest of them. You're not exactly the standard specimenen yourself occurring, I say, noticing her wings.

You refer to kind of gestures to the wings and the feet.

I refer to just making like wild hand gestures.

I' the whole of it.

Stricts are not generally found outside of their communities.

Well, what what you here then?

I don't the exception.

I rather think if I divulge that information, you might find me laughable. So I shall keep it to myself until we and she kind of pauses and runs through like almost like trying to translate it in her head. ' lunch right now . Is that the word for it?

All the word insts and she lets out this like guttural kind of screech sound.

I rather think it's familiarity.

That'll come with time.

Come on, let's go go get some grub.

I' hungry.

We can tell you about our tasks that we have today.

I will lend you my assistance where I can.

During the book, I'll introduce myself as Leanna and tell her I'm aana so do all the pleasant trees and everything.

You are also unusual.

You have a little one.

Okay will you touce himself as an apple farmer and give an apple as his She will give him a very polite bow and take the apple very carefully and tuck it very gently into a side pouch.

She's gonna find a disintegrated apple later apple has to be eaten straight away.

I guess the walk over to the the food hole we kind of give you the rundown of what we just did like tasing all these gremins out. Um and well one thing I want to check out in the dorm when we get back there after lunch or at some point is to try and find a trap door because we found this massive complex of tunnels that seemed to lead to most buildings.

It would be interesting to see if there's one in our our dascin I would be honored to assist you with your investigation.

It sounded like you were having a good look around your room before we entered.

Did you find anything in there?

Do you find any secret doors, a secret trap doors, anything like that?

There's a bit of a bashful look on aory's face.

She kind of like shuffles her wings a little bit.

In truth, I was seeking to elevate my sleeping area and I fell off the bed.

I die fall off, but it's still audible, but I try and you know like this is really part of like I' believe I'm admitting this kind of smile on her face. That's that's cool.

You're trying to make it your own place.

I love it.

Indeed, if I am to study here and spend an extended amount of time here, I wish to be comfortable.

Well, of course, if there's anything we can do to get that bed as high as we can get it, you know, just let us know.

I don't know if we'll be much use of that looking at our lights.

Like I'm trying to be nice, Your offer is very kind and noted.

You're welcome.

So have you done much of a tour around the place?

Unfortunately I have not.

I have only just arrived as I mentioned it before.

The journey here was longer than expected.

There are certain issues that I had to take care of en route, but I am here now.

I suppose we can give you the rudimentary tour after we get get some eating done.

I meanunnels there is there indeed a light source to these tunnels?

Not unless you. Like wiggles her fingers on her right hand and little lights start dancing around them.

I'd say I was quite useful in dark andarias.

Well, that could have been useful 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago. Oh well if you can fit down there We won't until we try.

Yeah.

And we won't try until we ate, so let's get some lunch. Sorry can we go uh Le was it?

Liz.

Yes.

It was.

Would you care to sit with me for lunch?

I can. Pick a chair pick a table.

Yeah, you guys are married to the dormitory and comes out and says, for something to eat for lunch.

We can get some of the leftovers from breakfast and last night's dinner, almond some bread, for you to eat something uh that should fill you up. . I'm be like almost I don't know how it conspicuous I could be, but kind of not stompy but like stepping hard to make a sound to try and find a trap door. Page that we get nin I'm going to say that you don't find it with this method. Um you give me an intelligence check. Or society?

That 2023. Um yeah, okay.

So you're just like going around the common area and you think basically on where you have found these tunnels, it's unlikely that it's going to be in like a common it's probably in the back somewhere.

So you probably have to get into the back of the kitchen, um, and have a look around. Or find like a storage room or something.

Like generally from what you've seen so far these are in the back.

Yeah, that makes sense.

I probably won't push my luck going in there.

You don't wanna annoy the food preparations.

Yeah, so I'm gonna assume that you guys get breakfast and this is your one meal because you only get two meals a day, um so, but like yeah she's able to let me is friendly and able to grab something up for you if you see breakfast and it's what?

Yeahited No, probably not hungry, but, yeah, um you can always get a you might want a more varied diet than just apples.

Yeah, we're not.

I mean, I'm saying that we have enough snack to go to, right?

I mean there are various preparations at apples.

Apple slices.

But she has an hour she has an hour, right to complete any of these recipes, at which point the apple will disappear from recipe.

Yeah.

It's not even an hour. She won't be able to make an apple pie doesn't like an hour is even cutting it close with cooling and everything. There's there's but not today.

Yeah, so you guys eat and get to know each other a little bit better than no other students come you.

I'm say that that they had breakfast, but because you guys are starting these activities pretty early yeah.

Well, it sounded like from what was happening before. Is and sitting or are they going to go off on their own?

I envision they were sitting of your like overall group but they're like actually like sitting off on a separate table like they can say that It's more that had only spoken very briefly to Leanna and was formally asking her to sit with them for lunch. Yeah, you guys can roleplay games to know each other or we can just stay that you did. You already did a bit of roleplay that's fine. Um but yeah, you can have lunch and get to know each other.

It takes about an hour and you still have I would say like four hours or even more of down downtime if you want it.

You have yeah, you have a little bit of downtime to do stuff if you want.

Well, we've got to return the bell as well at some point to. You might as well show you where the powder pile is I did yeah interesting sort of correct word for it I suppose.

Did he also have you mulled something out of clay?

Yes, yeah, he did and I'm going to show the be on my head.

Well, he made you mold it out of clay and then he took that and he gave you a sack bead.

I choose to believe that that clay turned into the bead, regardless of whether that's the truth or not. Your preg I'm not going to y I say yeah he made me this thing out of clay and then then it turned into this like last things I don't know like crazy right I start telling a qu curry about the when we were going through the tal, we found our way into the Akon library and I was just I going on like in full detail from what I in the brief time I was up there about all the parchments and everything.

So I'm probably boring her the death, but she is listening with rapt attention.

I mean most people here would find that interesting because we did all come here to learn magic.

Yeah, and we will say that you will be able to end downtime when you've got a bit more Well, I would say even half a day you could probably go try to research something, but it'll take it'll take a cumulative amount time to discover something unless you roll really well.

But that but you might be able to expand your formulas and crafting stuff.

I'd like to like if we have the time, maybe go into a library and see we can find a map of the tunnels. , yeah, that's also something you could do with your downtime. Yeah, well, what do you guys want to do with the downtown now?

Like that was mention of giving a quarry a tour, um a bit more of an extensive one.

You could go back to the markets, you couldore the tunnels, you could go to the library, you could just chill and unwind.

Or you could even like go out and seek out other students and just have chats with them and it'd just be like getting to know them a bit more.

Like, you can seek out specific people to try to become chummier with them.

I do need to check in on Matilda um but then I'm happy to do um whatever the acida party's into it'd be nice to get to know some of the people here though a little bit better.

Matilda at least can get out an open window in your room and and it is is it generally just a dorm cat and not confined to your room typically So um yeah, you probably find that like someone like Anaroot would probably be gravitating towards um your cat a little bit and I was like very curious about it and it might be yeah, trying to become friends with your cat.

Fantastic.

Um, yeah, so or you can make up your own downtime activity stuff. But is there anything you guys would like to specifically do this afternoon you can split up as well you don't have to do it as a full group momentum of having a look at the tunnels doesn't need to be a whole lot downt our whole downtime, but I should probably have a look back at them after lunch or either that'll as um suggested we could try and find the map of it because it would be good to have both.

Yeah, yeah.

Well, um O, would you like to come with me to a library and see if we can find them at?

Well, um the boys he can go about their business.

It'd be great to like spend some time with another woman as well.

If you require my assistance, it would be my honor to assist.

Fantastic.

Yeah, okay.

So I'm assuming you go personally just you to return the bells.

I'm assuming you're going to return the bells um unless you want unless you want to forget that. Um and okay, so you want to find the um the a map of the tunnels. Um Since you have Mambiaore Paul, why don't you roll me a Mambia law check?

All right.

I got a so you know that the records relating to school aren't in the libraryries.

They're not the arch tree stump and wearing any of the other smaller libraries.

They're more likely to be in the Heron archives. Um But you also know that you need teachers permission to do research to the higher archives they're a little bit more just because the information is a little bit more sensitive because like on the school, you will need a teacher's permission to access records in the archives.

Okay, um so before we like the plan was they always splitting up a foot, but before that happens, I'm going to relay that to those guys and I might say so like it's really not much point going to the libraries for that and we can't really get to the archives through the front door.

Maybe there's a tunnel.

Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

All right, well then let's go through the tunnunnels again.

Yeah.

So where do you start from?

Just I just wondering, like, did you go back to the storage bond?

Do you make way to the ark on library, or do you sneak in through the star dormitory?

Or do you try to a a new tunnel chap or something?

I think we should I mean I'm aware of the layout of the um the place so I think we should go go to the arch library and we just go east or almost there, right?

Through.

Let's let's head over.

Let's head back.

Don't get too distracted um by the by the books.

I'll try my best.

Yeah, you guys can make your way back to the Artlon L library and not suspiciously at all, make a big line straight straight for this. Like never almost never access to storage room in the bath. Um and midway into a trap door or the librarian you up a little bit curiously, like just in the way of the library. And it feels like Phoenick is leading the way, so Phyix give me another I think it's I can't think of anything else.

I'll do it.

I will note I probably won't lead because I am about it at seeing in the dark but I'll set the direction so I got a an eight you like me to illuminate the area?

Yeah, that be that'd be good yeah I think I think I've got it though I think I think we go this way but yeah you lead the way theory is going to use dancing lights.

Yeah, you set up the lights and Phoenix starts leading the way very confidently and he does and you make your way to a ladder. And you up confidentuddenly and find a Yeah, I think we lost Phil.

I was not if we lost me or just then. He confidently climbed up the ladder Well, I did well now we definitely lost , I'm I don't.

I think my discord what was the last thing you guys heard Confidentidently climb up ladder and offives on the 20 30 meters that we switching to Metric the the top TTRPG will will not be happy.

The American ones areoker notoriously metric.

Now what's that in furlongs?

Let's say 90 feet that way then and uh I suppose the real the real the way you got you got lost basically and essentially this way you came to the storage bone and you came up that right turn that you didn't go up that first time you went left.

So that's why you you didn't really recognize it until you actually got up there right on the ladder storage bar.

Yeah, I mean you slowly getting your bearings more.

You got three locations, but yeah, why don't you give me a survival check that you try to find the arch and obviously you went a different way this time so you sort of you are getting better.

I'd say the more exploring you do with this place, the lower these d get to find. Could be you or it could be someone else.

Yeah, I'm gonna kind of abdicate my I go to San it was this place.

If you think it's over that you the way the way.

I can try I'm not terribly confident myself, but you would a shot.

Do you need a survival Jack?

Six. Um we're probably too long survival people.

You you find it you you try to go to a few, um you find it you find a couple of trap doors and you try to like open them up and it's not that they're locked.

You think that they might be locked at first and then you realize that no, it's actually there's just something really heavy on top of this.

They must have forgotten about the trap door or just there's like there's definitely something the furniture on it that's just too heavy to budge. People wanted their beds really high, so they had to cover the trap door, yeah And you like I'll say that you find a few of these, but like you hit a few dead ends like you basically spend an hour hitting dead ends. Because you pretty bad What happens when people look at the people with bad survival else feels more confident in their ability to find this I'll give Yeah, at this point you're a little bit lost as well.

I think um I think Leiana wants to try and like, take a leap of faith and try and get us back on track.

Yeah.

So have we gone through any surprisingly damp sections?

Um high or those?

High?

No, good.

I rolled a 47.

Roll survival check if you're gonna lead the way, Leanna.

Okay.

Yeah, with a 22, you are I able to steer the group back on track. You know you first go back to the storage barn and you clockep, that's the storage bar.

I know that.

And then say you find it like we haven't gone down this way but before and you go down this way um and you see just a little bit of light um coming from a ladder and you go up there and you find yourself in some sign of some sort of library room, but it's instead of books, it's more like there are books, but there's a lot of like documents and there seems to be big um twoans, um or bigger sheets of things and maps, maybe.

But it does appear that you you found some sort of art.

Awesome sauce.

Oh, you did it.

Yeah, who would have thought I could get us back on track.

I was a bit doubtful.

I'll say at this point in time it is it's not it's like getting it's likeish afternoon, probably about four in the afternoon.

You spent I would say that that you probably spent two and a half hours exploring tunnels. While we found our way to a few interesting places, I don't know if we should stay in the archives long.

We might get in trouble if we're caught here.

Yeah, we got to keep it quiet.

Do we want to spend time trying to find the maps or do we want to just head straight back?

Well, we know where this place is maybe when it's a little bit quieter, like a time where it isn't so busy, maybe we could check it out.

So could you mark?

Well is that a curry?

Are we not to be here?

Might be found upon a little bit.

I think there's against being under it. It looks a little bit wary about the whole idea but it kind of bugs it off like it's my first day maybe this is the norm well I guess when when we climb back down I'll just write the hair and archives underneath and Yeah, well, do we want to head back to the dorm again or find anyone?

Does anyone want to speak to anyone?

I think we got to find our way out.

Yeah, so I mean you can make the storage bond is not too far and you can make your way back there easy enough because of the way you got here, but you could go exploring for your own dormitory or something else using these tunnels.

You are running out. Of downtime boring.

But on a rain day, you might be able to get through some tunnels.

I think with the rest of the downt time, I might want to just go back to the um the dorm and maybe chat with whoever but like see if anyone's there and and have a chat to I or all some other people. Um yeah let me let me roll a couple of D9s to see who's just around.

I see the Phoenix next home we get down there.

We'll have to find a way to get into the kitchen. Not the cafeteria, but the actual kitchen itself. Get the good stuff.

Exactly.

Yeah, well I suspect that the trap door will be either in the storage or in the actual kitchen itself. A way, I think that we'd have a very happy pho um yeah, when you get back to the dormitory, I assuming all of you are going back to the dormitory or are you splitting off to go to other things?

I'll go back.

It'll be good to clean up a little bit guessing we're as you when you get back to theometry you see anchor root speaking with an athletic looking human and when he sees and when they see you approaching, he goes, oh, you must be the new students.

The name's areoro ob.

Lovely to meet you. It's nice to meet you too.

I suppose you're probably one of the last people that we haven't met.

I think I've met most of you uh well I haven't I think you met most of us yet uh maybe you haven't met Noxol yet and we spent a lot of time uh running around um and training if you're ever interested in a spa, you could meet us on the sparring grounds.

Keeps out in mind.

I'm more of you ever feel like playing a board game?

I am quite a collection.

I was thinking about having a game night later this week if any of you were interested.

I haven't played a ball game since I was a child.

So I might be keen for that bi weekly game It's we'll say it's once every two weeks there's a game night.

Oh, sounds like fun.

Have you guys heard of this game called Pothfinder?

I've heard some things about it.

It sounds too complicated for me there.

I heard it is quite a complicated game. Uh, perhaps we could get better and play it later.haps.

So how long have you been like hiding around here it'sorm.

I've been here for a while.

I just haven't seen you guys around much.

Um, but I was hoping to meet you. Um I think I was me and Knoxola were gonna take you for your fifth trial.

Any any hints?

He tips.

What can I say?

Um just, uh take note of take note of things. Be observant.

I'm sure you'll be fine.

I I've heard about you. Uh from Taco.

Yeah.

I'll be great.

We'll all will all be great.

And aali is sorry, aory is there too, right?

This is joining us tomorrow?

Uh tomorrow from now and kut pipes up and says, I think I'm I'm I'm taking you tomorrow I'm helping you tomorrow, uh me and Mariama and uh Chizar for the cascade bearers.

Wait, wait, wait wait, I just have a epiphany right now.

Wait, wait, wait wait wait wait, wait. A coreo. Aory a core are you guys you guys like appeared to be.

No, I am pretty much assuming as they come.

I thought it might have been like those buds where like like a peacock where like the the males are like super normal looking and then the women I should probably stop talking now.

I'm sorry that's maybe of a giggle.

Corey kind of strang to back to tuck her hands behind behind him.

It is amusing.

I think I might go jump in the bath because I'm filthy. Yeah hey can you put the map up so we can see where aory's room is compared to the rest of us took the room near the southern exit.

I believe nobody else have taken that room.

Okay.

Sorry, this helps me with the visual.

Yeah, that's okay..

So is any do you all go clean up?

I don't know if we all at the same time, but yeah.

Well there's bars and there's androoms as well.

I feel like you about the all right um can we I'm I'm gonna go to the uh I believe it's the north one map left of the one without your friends.

I'm not saying that, but yes.

I'm just a little too enthusiastically saying like, yeah, I'll go yeah, we'll go to the north one.

Sure.

Atilouri that this little one got attacked by a piece of the paper not long after we arrived here.

Indeed. That was a rough.

That was a bit unclear, remember just didn't quite catch clearly.

I don't think anyone did. Say?

I said that he did not fare well.

He was covered with paper cut all over.

That sounds very painful.

I trust God suffering from his injuries.

All I good, just minor setback, nothing to worry about, you know.

Anyway, I'll go over in the north flushroom. When we popped up in the star dormitory, whereabouts in the dormitory itself, did we pop up, like kind of a back corner type thing?

Or I would say that it would actually be in like um one of the toilets, essentially.

Okay.

I mean, using that as a starting place after I have a bath, I'm gonna do a bit of exploration and find a tunnel.

Okay, sure.

And yeah, cool.

Um first off, so okay, so the three guys are going to one washroom and two girls are going to the otherroom so Gemma and Liz give me perception checks as you there just something you might notice.

That was pretty good. Uh yeah, so we'll say like you're still getting new to this place a. Um and when you're in the you're just like every now and then you you're flicking on your detect magic just to have a look around.

And when you're in the when you're in the room in the in the the bath, the east bath, notice that there's some abandoned laundry. And then like as you just start flicking around with the technatic, you notice it has a little glimpse of magic from this like little bit of cloth that's just discarded in the laundry. iana, that laundry over there.

Yes, um don't think it's mine.

I think I took it back to my room.

You were told that this is a band basically just a place for abandoned laundry.

Okay.

There is something of persuasion in there.

Is there anything in the room that I could use as a bit of a prong to kind of lift it up?

I'm a little bit hesitant to actually touch anything. Like you like a brush or something like that oh yeah just curious um yeah uh I'll use the brush and I'll part of around and pull it out.

Yeah, you could do that.

Give me a give me a reflex. Or a thie check as you're trying to take you're trying to obviously pick these things up without touching them.

18?

Yeah, you're easily pick them up using the brush and they sort of dangle and it's basically just like, um, like a bandage. Um sort of probably about eight feet, ten feet long.

There's two of them, actually.

Well, how about we put them on the bench and we go wash up and then we can tell the rest of the group about what these could possibly be?

Unless you have a different idea.

I will take your lead on this.

That's good. Yeah just pop into the bar and the tapon go for it yeah it's like because it's like an the bath is always full like um yeah, you guys wash up and when you're washing up yeah what do you do about the I'm use the brush and I'm gonna walk out with it and I think it's fit would the boys back in there be back in their rooms or are they still cleaning up?

I probably might still be searching for a trap door okay I mean I'd have a bath and then start looking I don't know how long that would take in each room for the trap door I'm check like first like the bath the toilet on our side and then go to the other ones yeah why don't you give me a perception just at eleven.

Yeah, you start stumping around looking around but you can't find anything. Um you're you're looking you're trying to like hear the like hollows behind the areas and knocking on things and everything seems pretty solid to you.

I'd have to give one of my friends to help later.

But you were definitely as you're doing this, you come across uh Leanna and I suppose are Cory um carrying these uh bandages.

Doing some cl cleaning or something.

Yeah, we found these in the bathroom.

They look magical. And I've showing the bandage is hanging up the brush.

Would recommend not touching them.

I've already got it in my hand. Happened.

They they feel good to the hand.

I think are some good quality bandages.

Do you know what do you know what the magic is on them?

I haven't determined that yet.

I don't know if my magic um and my alchemist abilities can work that out.

I was thinking maybe you or maybe Phoenick might know something I don't have much in terms of identifying items I don't don't believe um because you need the like the magic or something, don't you feel?

I think it's trained in. If it's if you trained inana, you can do the identify magic actionana well well. With the I say that you I say that's okay.

You know that these are plus one hand mighty blows.

Interesting.

What is?

Thetrical bandages.

I don't think any of us fight with their fists unless unless you doari.

I do not.

But I appreciate you asking. Oh well I guess I'll I'll put them in my room for an hour and then we can um work out who to give them to later.

Have you found any trap doors?

No.

I haven't found any in this side. Um just heading to the other side to have a look.

I mean I I'll be more than happy if you give me a hand.

I'm not faring so well with this so far.

Well, did you want to join us or did you want to hang out with and the Apple bearer?

So believe that my assistance would be needed, I would of course be glad to help. Well I feel you you look like you might be a bit more perceptive than I am so fingers crossed so we go to the bathroom the wash areas that haven't been assessed yet.

Yeah, you can give me another you go around with theect magic and you don't find anything else.

I am not detecting any further magical presence. The trapors weren't magic No.

So you' looking for the trapors still.

You' not looking for thought they said you were you were searching the washrooms still more magic. Me a perception check going through the washrooms, you don't find anything.

No, even with a 17, you don't find any more things.

And I'll say at this point it's like just you're searching and you look up and it's like it's past sunset now.

Probably not like it's probably been like sunset it was probably 20 minutes ago.

So you know that the kitchen closes in about an hour and a half.

Oh, we don't want to miss that.

We should we go get some food before they let us in.

Yes, we're having something a different variety tonight.

I mean it is the spice of life. Grab P and Ou and head over.

Okay.

Yep, so you guys grab Finninocco, head over to dinner, um and when you get there, you see um Essie and Heyram are also having dinner.

Does we wanna sit with them?

We'll find a table for ourselves.

We might as well sit with them. Sit with them and Heyram introduces himself.ram is a strong looking dwarf.

Gemma and she says, you must be the new student of Kyri. What did I have for?

From.

Definitely not this. Was definitely not the bows formally. No need for such formality. . How are you finding the dorms?

Quite comfortable.

I see that you have a wings that are you able to fly?

Not all stricks are entirely capable of flight.

I have ability more of a long jump than truth bight.

F fair enough.

Well I like to glide myself, get some air and hang um if you if you go uh to the uh the one of the spires, you can jump and use that as a launching point.

Indeed, I will have to investigate on my own time, but I appreciate your candor.

Well, if you have a wish to come join me at 60 feet high in the air.

Good time. Climbs her head.

Yeah, so that's I'll say that's the secret you learn.

Otherwise, you sort of just get to know each other a little bit of dinner.

We can role play more, but like we probably need to roleplay everything out.

But yeah, that's the thing you learn about at dinner, um unless there's anything specific you guys want to ask, but if not, you guys can retire and go into the morning.

Is that cool?

It's with me.

Cool.

So we transition to the Zorn, um, and you guys um make your way to the the normal meeting place. Um and you see uh three figures waiting in front of the door ds for you.

One of them is called up on a blanket. Say very random after finding some miraculous dry spot and they seem half asleep. But Marioama is observing the drowsy cat folk with detached interest before turning to raise a hand and greeting. From an objective standpoint, it's really impressive how he can sleep anyway.

Anyway, where Caspic carry bearers, or at least I am and anaroot is filling in because Chizar is Chiziah?

Ascade bearers advanceical theory.

It's also our job to make new magic safe for everyone to use, so we don't have a repeat of the exploding nose incident.

We don't talk about the exploding nose incident.

What is we don't talk about the exploding nose incident. For what I know about the exploding nose inc academia would be a very hard have right Liz's much to have heard about this.

Okay, so if I'm doing is this for you.

All right, well, I got an 11.

I'm going to remind you.

I have the DV feet.

I don't know if that's gonna come into it might be a success spot. One thing and one real thing.

So you know that the explodingodes incident you remember that that someone Yeah, definitely exped or maybe someone died.

You're not a hundred percent sure, but it was bad.

I'm going to say that's you can remember with your check.

I suppose is oh yeah, I know the exploding nose incident.

Some died, right or less expelled don't talk about the exploding nose incident.

Anyway, since you've shown us there are gremlins around, we're going to do some sparkling finger wiggles to help deal with that.

We need some special oils to do the ritual. Though anrew is here to tell you what to get.

The small knoll squeaks and flinches as a t attention to turn to it um we need scarlet cap oil. Bone oil and Ankar whimpers and visitor paused together a caterpillar oil, uh, but they need to be the right uh I'll just I'll just show you. And if you have trouble making the oil sorry. If you have trouble making oil, come back here and I'll w wake his eye up.

He's good at brewing.

Mariana adds, be done in eight hours or you'll miss dinner and try to have fun.

Um So Anorut is showing you a particular type of caterpillar, um that she has in like a little terrarium. Uh, and it's it is fuzzy caterpillar, fairly um fairly unique you think like just after starting it for a bit, you'll be able to recognize it if you find the same one.

Okay. And the red cap is that some form of mushroom?

Yeah, yes. Um it should be growing outside the city. And the bone is for the bone, you'll need lucky bones. Sounds like a dog.

I had a cat named Lucky. You can just bring me a lot of bones and I'll I can pick up the lucky ones if that works.

Is there a symmetry around here?

Why would you why would you get bones from a cemetery?

Some people put bones in in their graves.

I don't their relatives will appreciate us digging through their remains. Don't bones, please get bonesalones asones.

We might be able to the there's some bones that they're not using from cooking and what not.

Yeah, they wouldn't give us the lucky bones, would they?

Well, I guess we should start looking around for all these things. Do we know how much do we need of these?

We could just squeeze that one caterpillar.

Well get me about this these um these are the mushrooms you need, get me about this much again. These ones are dried though, so make sure you get any fresh ones for the oil.

There's no oil in these ones. Um um and get me a couple of caterpillars. Um and just get me as many bones as you can because unless you know that they're definitely lucky.

Well, we can always stay in the kitchen like it was just suggested.

Yeah.

They took of any animal or just lucky anything anything you can find just don't don't don't commit crimes please there's a pet cemetery around here. That would work if there is one.

Let's start with the kitchen first.

Okay. Go to the kitchen, um and it's still morning, um will it's still breakfast, um and says, um, will you find her cooking and she says, uh, bones, you want bones.

I don't have any at the moment. Uh, they all went to the dogs. Um you could go speak to the butcher.

They probably help you out. Um or you could ask around lucky bones.

You could ask around town maybe. Thank you that's a good place to start. Um sounds like we've got to go out of the academy no matter.

So we want to start looking for the bones or do the mushrooms or caterpillars?

Well, we got to figure out where we can find these caterpillars. It was quite specific about these.

It could always go to's favorite place.

There might be a book on them.

So she basically said, um um I guess would have said that the the mushrooms grow at a specific area, the jungle about an hour outside of town.

The caterpillars are everywhere but we'll just take time to find them because they're small and the jungle is.

I know the jungle fairly well. If we want to start heading there and then see if we find caterpillars on the way. Got anything to put them in?

Have we got anything to put the caterpillars in?

We could just put them in your bag or like wrapon in cloths or something like that.

If you want jars or something like that you in your mouth.

You can go get that sort of thing from the p powder pile.

Yeah, the whole mouth thing is not entire thing.

Well, I not said to the powder pile first.

Oh, okay.

I'm just chuck in my backpack.

It's fine.

Okay.

To the jungle into the jungle So what are you doing for it?

Are you looking for looking for caterpillars?

Is spending time searching for those?

Or are you going to go straight to making a beeeline for where the mushrooms grow?

Taterpillars first and then kind of do it both in a way, like head towards the mushrooms. But while we're doing that look for caterpillars. Was my thought Sure, but you are doing caterpillars first. And so you're not going to be walking fast in that direction if you just doing detailed searches.

So yeah, I I will get everyone to make either a nature, survival or perception unless you've got well, you got jungle law, don't you, Laurie?

Yes, I do.

I'll let you do a jungle.

I'll allow that in certain place of nature or survival.

I got 25 on perception, but then you didn't include perception in that list just survival Laurie find one first with a takes you to and yeah and you find one and while you're trying to figure out how to grab that how did you Pho?

I ? i find one about the same time so yeahri finds one first and then Uku and also find one so yeah sort of all found one and you' got three people trying to figure out how to pick them up although goes first.

How do you go about picking them up?

Look like a Bruce like one like one you probably shouldn't touch?

Yeah, you were told that they be quite painful to I am going to try and find a big leap or something that I can kind of put in front of it for it to crawl on and then um the tap to put it in my bag afterwards.

Yeah, give me a slide of hand check.

Seri, you mean?

Side of hand or yeah, or the side hand is a thing.

It is, not on much unless it's somewhere else on the sheet.

Maybe it is.

I see my theri. Roll the 20 is pretty good.

Yes, yeah, yeah, they are definitely able to do it. Um it's quite seamless, um and you have a caterpillar.

You've got a couple you found a couple more or other people are gonna try to get extras.

I don't words we'll go to Uku next.

Ukku, are you doing it?

Are you trying to capture your caterpillar as well?

Why not?

What am I rolling?

I just described to me how you're doing it first.

You know that touching it will be painful.

I do I use a little bit of piece of wood.

I can Yeah, I would say that just with time you're able to get it onto a piece of wood, um and you have a caterpillar on the end of a piece of wood. And then what do you and then what are you just gonna carry around a piece of wood with a caterppillar on it?

I am currently.

So that's happening and you also found a caterpillar. At this point everyone other people like everyone can go and help if they wanted to but how would you you found it first?

How would you go about trying to pick this up?

I mean I got I mean not. inetic can also so I don't want to touch it so I'm gonna use my I'm gonna major chant and trying to pick it up with that.

No, I think we're putting it in to um was it screens bag?

Whose bag are we putting these in?

Yeah, that I open up the pouch that I put mine in my hand ently slides it in.

Yeah, yeah and and we say you found a third so yeah it's you about an hour to find three caterpillars.

We just needed three, it was it only one okay then she'll be happy with us. Let's continue on try and find these m you keep going towards the place where you were told that the mushrooms yeah they don't look like any other kind of this going back is a they don't look like any kind of poisonous mushroom in the area. So you shouldn't make a fatal miscaration. Need ones that have received a lot of sunlight and moonlight. So you'll probably have to go pretty high on a jungle tree.

They're called tree blood.

I guess with that information we kind of look for a suitable location.

Yeah, you get to this area after, yeah, about an hour of travel. Um um all up, you probably it's probably by the time you get here after your initial chat, um it's probably been about two hours since you were given the task. Um and you see a tree that is covered in mushrooms and it's um as high as 20 feet up in the air and its trunk stands in the middle of its clearing.

And you see some like loads with some big several like these big wide leaves dripping down from the top of the tree. And we see mushrooms attached to it?

Yeah, there's mushrooms up and down this tree and you were told to get ones from up high. Well I'm gonna like go over to it and just have a look at some of the ones that are down low and just say well, these look like the ones are probably not the one to get the ones up there though.

anyone , want to reach up?

Any is anyone anyone good with climbing?

Well, you don't need to climb if you can jump the whole way up. Would I be able to make the jump?

It's 20 feet high up.

It would be a few jumps. And so yeah, it would still be an athic it' still be an athletics check to sort of jump and like scramble.

I thought you were given a curry double jumped.

I can get thatinder, but not yet. Just doing some math.

I need to math the math.

Well I should say it's a big tree 20 feet up where you can start seeing mushrooms.

You don't see mushrooms at your level.

You'd have to climb up, and then, yeah, you probably only get one as high as you can go.

So there've been a movement of 25 feet, according to this.

I need at least 10 feet of run up. At least 10 different.

Okay, so I get an extra 10 feet so I could I could in theory make the full jump with a 10 foot run up.

I would still need to rule for it unless I'm reading this role.

Yeah, I think you still need to roll that.

I'm, I still say you need to roll an athletic check to climb up there, scramble and grab the mushroom.

Yep, it looks like you can't fail, I think it is.

Or you don't automatically fail.

Oh, I see. High jump or long jump if you don't stride at least 10 feet first we want vertical, we don't want.

All right, but that being said, I should make that roll.

Are the rest of you just sort of standing around looking at the tree or are you clumped or what are you doing?

I mean, that felt like it didn't wouldn't have taken any in world time as well, but um we're just chatting about it 's not too bad.

Yeah, the 15, you're able to flutter up and clamber and get up to where the mushrooms are and rats start grabbing a few, but as you do, um you hear a creaking noise as this creature seems to be falling using a branch to fall out of the tree. And I will get like they fall out they they use this branch to um slow their fall down and they land next to I'm gonna say uh I'll roll a four a D4 to see who they go to.

I've got an order here. Yeah that makes sense.

They go they land next to the small rat folk um and I'm gonna say they attack. And oh no so he'll land in this place where we all sort of clumped together. So um I will Yeah.

I'm really hoping we don't because I prerolled it and I got eight.

I I got a nap one on it but Sixteen is not too bad.

What was yours Pho?

Eight?

Eight.

Yeah.

Ourie and Ukku.

Ori I've got a 16. And Uku?

Initiative.

That's perception, yeah.

Okay, I 16 and nine. Used to these characters sheets.

No web perception is. Here this guy, this mushroom humanid person, they were hidden in the top of the tree so this they get their surprise attack off so I'm going to need a fortitude save.

I've just sort of randomly put people in the next in places from Uu.

Leanna and Skriinn your nodiness. Ooh, pretty good 24 you pass I'm guessing Jimbo probably doesn't have a plus 20 or anything so I do not that I never got accur. . I think I've got this right the moment nothing immediately happens, but um you start coughing and you feel like probably if you feel exposed to this thing whereas screen you feel kind of okay about it like you want weren't so exposed.

Yeah, I should um actually let me double check something really quick.

Poison.

Yeah, so nothing happens immediately, but you feel like this purple sport have gotten into your lungs um a little bit. Um and then they're going to move and they're going to make a make a punch attack against Skrin and it is a 21 to hit.

You take nine blooding damage.

And that is the end of his turn and we'll start in the top with Oku. This thing's um just punched your little rat folksrin.

He's about 10 feet away from you. Um yeah, you're close to it with um Leanna as well.

Sorry, not cutting.

I'm not really getting what you're saying sorry it's not coming clear. A tree.

Okay.

You can summon a tree?

I will summon Okay. Um I'll just um you say that's a that's um again, remember we're using roll 20 for us, but the podcast, the listeners will not see that so you' going to say I'm summon it next to the next.

Okay.

It's as many times as I want.

It should have like a number of actions for you could have one action left if we'd like to do something move, shield is arranged weapon?

I have a infusion make my audio is coming to realzy.

I'm not sure if there's a problem with your microphone or something. It's okay now, but it was pretty bad before. Nice.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay, so, yeah, so you have a weapon?

Is it an action to prime that infusion or is it Okay. Um and so I can you think like I Basically it hits an mind on the dice that will definitely.

Actually what are your total?

It might be it might be a critical but that doesn't really matter.

It probably is a critical tree has AC 10 points of 10 and if it tries to strike an adjacent and it takes it damage are there any like pebbles or small rocks on the ground near me?

I'm gonna grab a few.

I'm gonna put my sling out and I'm gonna try and hit him.

Okay so you can do that yeah, you can do.

Yeah it'll be an action to grab a few rocks and then yeah you can take a.

Okay.

I'm guessing I miss with a nine.

It's just gonna go Capel over to the side.

Yep, that absolutely misses. , I's feel so deflated.

And you have one action left if you'd like to do something.

Um I'm gonna can I move myself behind um a echo tree, like to have a bit of like a meat shell type of thing?

All right, I'll do that then.

Yeah, you're no longer within five feet of the mushroom man. , like that.

Awesome.

Thank you.

Next up is Skri.

Okay.

So I am going to uh use my spell strike, but I will put in my leveled spell, um shocking grasp so it will hopefully hit and do lots of damage.

Yeah.

It will probably not hit with a that one.

So okay so you've got a at one.

Some uh maybe we haven't talked about this, um but onike, but um that's on. Um but in class I twoE, you get what is known as a heroo point. Um you get one just for showing up. Um in podcast term that means essentially you're going to get one every session. Um I will give you an extra one for amazing roleplay um or if we're doing a session it becomes really long, that you'll get a second hero point.

So essentially, once per podcast episode, you can just choose to reroll the D20.

Would you like to that one or would you like to keep your I think I would like to that's a little bit more reasonable, so that would be a 22 wall up.

Go ahead.

Perfect.

Okay, so I don't do much damage with the initial damage of it, but um let me just roll my shock and grasp as well.

That's a little bit better. Um so that would do an extra 15 electricity damage on top. 15 electricity damage.

I'm just looking if he's got any resistances.

No, no resistances to electricity.

So it takes 15 total.

Sixteen total.

Oh, yeah, 16, yeah, for their strike and then the okay, cool.

So that was two actions, although that all three re actions.

That would be two actions, and then as my last, I will enter my my cascade arcane cascade stands, which just dumb improves my damage for the next attack if I want to.

Great.ep, you can absolutely do that.

Perfect. Yeah, he seemed to be quite rocked by that attack.

That was a lot of damage. And then we will move to okiri. , so I am currently positioned on the tree branch correct?

Yeah, you feet up in the air. Just grabbed a couple of these mushrooms.

Oh, um do you notice the uh the yelling and the smell slinging down below and I would like to cast aine lights if I could please. Yes, divine lance. Listeners I unleashed beam of divine energy.

I need to make a spell, arrange spellch against the targets AC, and a hit the target will take two D4 spirit damage double on the credible. Legacy path so you're good, right?

It's pretty much the it's change, I classified as . , it's a 20 to that hits?

Well, so that is going to be So it's one plus I modifier, which charisma.

So that is going to be plus+4 is damage, he does seem to take it, meaning that he must be able. . So that was what two actions so you still have an action if you would like to do something, you can either climb down, you could shield.

Yes, I think shield might be a good idea. The end stay up there and cast shield on yourself.

At the end of his turn, he at the end of your turn, it's his turn.

He is going to attempt a sport domination against we'll say Leanna, because you failed against the purple pox.

I need a will save.

I will save.

Hopefully that's better than it's not.

Let's see how I roll.

That is a success.nt until the end of its next turn, you are helpful to my soloids and can't take hostile actions against them.

If attacked by one, you are freed from this effect.

But it's only until the end of the next turn.

And then he is going to try to hit scri again?

But that's only a four on the dice so that's a 15 to hit you screen.

That would miss That is.

And that is his turn. And then we moved to Philly well, I'm here guys okay so mechanically what I want to do is I will cast infectious enthusiasm, which will I encourage myself to improve it and say my motivation with my allies um and then I will direct my attention to the the dude here um and cast biting but um so let's say does anyone speak undercommon I do Yeah I have is he is he is making noises and if you speak undercommon you'll know what he's saying I don't no no one has undercom weirdly that doesn't matter like I feel like that's why it came up at that moment, doesn't matter for like bitings somehow. But um so for a create a sense that might will inspire you guys. Um I will say look this guy's got nothing on us.

We've got this and then I'm gonna look at him.

I'm gonna cut out fighting woods and I'm gonna roll a um what am I gonna roll?

Is it do I have to?

It's a spell attack.

It's a spell attack, um and I'm going to roll a 21. enty hits.

I'm gonna let him know if leave eaten scarier mushrooms than you at the cafeteria and that'll do seven nights.

Seven damage, what kind of damage?

Sonic damage.

Sonic damage, seven damage to them. What's the distance here?

Yeah, we'll stick stay at that distance.

Um, and I'll let you guys know, um, if anyone has a like one action, they can use it to pick up the plus one bonus to attack rolls damage rolls and say oh sorry, um I got the plus one to that thing as well, didn't I?

So it does one more damage than what I said it did.

So people can basically pick that up as an action just as like a shot kind of thing.

Cool. That's good to know for people coming up and the next person up is Ukku.

Your tree is looking okay, it didn't get attacked.

To be fair he didn't hit anything. elemental . Yeah, you yeah you' hit.

I' you got moderatees.

It's What kind of damage are you doing?

Bludge, did you say?

And Iize I was thinking of a bonus for free so it would be a plus one to the damage. , so what would you like to do I probably I create an apple in your hand a little tend blows up to your hand and apple in it.

You could eat it for one action next round. Sounds good.

Liz, it's Leanna's turn next and just in your hand in your head telepathically you hear you like feel the words umu umbu friend, no attack umbo as he's smashing your your new friend's screen.

Yeah, I'm not buying it.

So you are unable to take hostile actions against it. You do anything else, but you cannot take a hostile action against it. Can I instead of attacking him but attack his tree? 's tree but the tree in the middle I thought that was Mr. Naughty yeah I'm gonna try and attack this one because I don't know.

I can't be hostile to him I'll be hostile to the tree.

So I'm gonna do something a little different.

I'm gonna put my sling in my left hand and fumble around in my pocket and you're gonna people might see like a like a may look like a grey tennis ball. Just described putting something as an action, taking something up is another action, so you have one action left to make an attack.

Last night I'm throw this thing at the tree.

It'schem.

Yeah, it's one of my bombs.

I throw an alchemist fire at the lesser level at it.

So I'm going to dry and do like a bit of a feminine version of the baseball throw at the baseball bat and I'm going to try and hit it. Action to get out I think we'll have to decide how many quick items you guys have you can sort of pull out it's not gonna take you can have like a couple of potions a couple of bombs, maybe a scroll like you can have some stuff which are like quick access items. But we'll have to figure out a mechanic for that and we'll have to agree on it.

But for now, yes, I'll say that that wasn't two actions.

That was one action to put away your sling and one action to get a quick access bomb and throw it.

Okay, I'm gonna try and hit the tree.

Yep, making it hack.

Uh thing rolling the d Nothing's come up on my end.

Has it come up on any of anybody else's end?

I can't see anything.

Stupid TPG.

Draw the dice.

I completely miss it.

All right, I'm gonna use the heroPoint and I'll try once more.

Well it's and that's not much better. Am so thinking myself.

I am so inept.

I'm not normally like this OK I'm so stressed okay somebody just diminish this person please. Please diminish something 's a patch of burning somewhere under the tree, but definitely not on the tree because you eight total. If you . If you if you move the tree, then your actions are so I will as an action eat that delicious apple. Not nice because I bad but still health is better than no health um thank you can only updated that okay so I will use my two remaining actions to try to do another spell strike but just using a level zero spell this time not really great so that would be I get a plus one I think on top of that but at only 11. Uh yeah unfortunately 11 misses and yes, unfortunately that's my turn then.

Okay. Um after your turn it is aurious turn. . Okay, so he's still in range. Um second first was the first gonna try and hit him another one of those uh divine lenses.

Yep. Be a That's 21 to cancel.

That hits. That's slightly better.

That's six. Damage and yeah, your third action again.ace the shield. Sounds good. It is umbo's turn again.

That is his name.

I'm going to need a will save from Ukku.

Yes.

What did you get?

Not.

So what's the total?

I don't know what to actually.

Uh, it should be under like the defensive that you.

Okay, so for the next minute, you think that this creature is a friend and you can't take hostile actions against them.

But they are looking hurt, your friend, your friend is looking hurt..

But they are attacking your other friend and they're trying to try to punch screen because they get 15 again..

So I'm guessing that the triven if it hits me s still up there for the next one.

That's.

All right, um I'm going to try well, I will necessarily uh extend the rage anthem um and then after that we will use an electric o instead so for myus anthem, I will try and extend it a bit longer using lingering composition so first I will cast lingering composition uh to try and extend my anthem which is a performance chair So that's said 28enty it is a it is a standard what it explains that as is uh it is a usually a standard difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest target of my composition yeah you definitely against this guy uh with that I will uh normal success critical. So I will continue to I will recast the courageous anthem.

It'll last a bit longer this time and I'll just let everyone know like you guys are doing great.

We don't need to worry about this.

Have fun playing with your food it looks like because they're not hitting anything um so yeah um and then I will cast electric arc at it um I'll wait how close I'll we?

One two three I get to move a bit closer to do that, but like one unit closer I can't drag it.

I think you 30 feet aren't looks like you within that's.

Yeah.

So that's a reflex A for me for electric?

Yes.

Uh 24.

Probably what I think this is like half damage.

Because it's a basic reflex.

Yeah, yeah yeah. Um which means I got the max. Um so you guys you take four.

Oh, he takes four.

It takes well.

Who knows?. , we might be getting some of these rules right, but I think we're doing it okay.

Uh, cool.

So that is your turn. And then we go back up to the top to Ukku, um, who thinks that this this guy is a friend, but you can still help you can still make apples and things for screen.

I can that only works every like 10 minutes, I think what would you like it's just unlimited he What would you like to do with?

Just scream as distinct Okay, um give me a persuasion or intimidation check.

I think of my friends I I don't have any Christmas stuff so I think it's just a straight roll right?

I mean your mushroom friend doesn't know what you're saying. , but because don't unless you speaking in undercommon but I imagine feels a little bit bad about hitting your friend or maybe not.s up to.

We'll move on to Leanna.

You are able to make hostile action against it now.

Oh thank gosh. Um I'm gonna try would you okay, I know we haven't really talked about it about those mechanics, but I'm going to say I have one bomb left in my pocket.

So I'm going to divert out this a little bit from behind the tree from outside of the tree and I'm going to try and hit this bugger. Movement, yep.

And then up for a second movement, I'm gonna try and hit him with my alchemist fire. And a relin which really misses again.

I'm really encouraging backb burning here. Throw Yeah. So you have one action left.

I'm gonna go back behind the tree.

I don't think she'd have quick bomber yet so there's probably two actions to get the bomb out.

Okay, so it would have been so you don't get to move back the tree Okay, cool.

Okay.

Great.

That was and then we move on to. Try and hit him again, but we all seem to be rolling great.

I suppose you just leave and find ones for me.

Oh, that would be hits. Sorry was ging a , yeah, cool.

So I do an extra piercing and I'll roll my spell attack.

So that would be an extra eight piercing on top of that, but because I am in my i cascade, I also do an extra three electric damage.

OK, so is it all piercing damage or it's all except three uh that would be lightning.

Okay, so how much damage total?

That would be 11 piercing at three electric.

So 14 altogether.

Okay.

This guy is looking very hurt.

I'm very hurt.

Oh, and he looks like he's got bleed damage as well..

That's when you hit with gading claw persist ble damage.

Okay. Um so after is that have you still got one action left Oh yeah I would actually thank you. Um I think I'll just cast shield on myself and have that prepared to have up and then move on to O second third first is the first divine lands.

All right, roll the hit. . Uh, yeah, roll your damage. Five points damage.

Doesn't matter.

How would you like to kill this mushroom man?

Oh, yeah.

Kill ceiling.

No.

So yeah, well, uh everyone else is kind of like keeping it uh keeping its attention away, c's talons dig into the tree and she kind of lines up, holds a hand out and sort of wisps of ethereal light, just kind of work their way around her fingers and she could draws her arm back and then with a ear splitting screech sends this bolt of light and it just spears this thing from the back of the head through the forehead. And he does this and a pops down as he pops and another sp explosion happens.

I'm gonna need another fortitude save from screen laurie . We had no idea that was gonna happen that none of us did a check. Not one knowledge check was about that until then.

So that would be so I rolled pretty well.

Yeah you passed. Okay, so we are out of initiative and you guys can start looking around after about another 42 seconds after 42 seconds and Leanna take two poison damage and are stupefied one as you cough up a little bit of purple looking blood.

I literally rush to him and go no my friend 's a tattered husk I try to shove and no while you you cough up a little bit of looking and take two poison damage and that is where we will end the episode.

I think that was that's actually going to end up in a really long one although I feel like there was a bunch of dead air bit in there where we were like either talking over each other or hesitant to talk over each other or had to retakes and stuff so that might not be the best the funest edit job but hopefully it's not too bad that was your thank you very much hopefully you guys enjoyed that one.

There's a bit of everything in there.

It was fun.

Yeah. Very much enjoyable.

Yeah, like I was saying, I think you've got a really good group uh a mixture of different group things.

I'm really looking forward to when you do get to level two and you get your free dedication. But you gotta get through a bit more level one stuff first.

yeah. . Actually, Liz, what um Alma's feet did you pick up another one cause you might have quick bomber bummer throw was right giving him like a free round against you because he was coming at you from attack, but I probably needed to check double check surprise round and stuff prize attacks and stuff like that, but I think it was right the right thing to do.

It felt like the right thing to do.

And I also boosted his I changed his stat book a little bit.

He was a weak micoid, but since there's an extra one of you, I gave him extra HP and like I boosted some tiny. But I didn't he wasn't a full strength of Michael Lloyd. But apparently that guy was just a dick that was ejected from his regular colony..

He was exiled from his normal colony because he was a dick.

I mean, according to he's like the best of all of us guys have to figure out what's going on with the poison effect.

You guys might have to do some knowledge checks after all.

Yeah. Was it was the new girl?

Yeah, it was totally hurt.

I was just patting him on the back with my sword. Damn it.

All right.

I'm gonna head off.

I'll see you guys later.

Bye See you.

Yeah, it was good to actually use spell strike this time because I think the last time I tried to use it I missed.

I think once I'm out of a treaty and I can actually assist with other people and give them the bonuses that I actually got Yeah.

I was in a tree.

So you're kind of what did youlele Yeah, you originally go and we switched to Cosos.

She doesn't have a sponsored background.

We ended up going this um astrological a thing.

It's a bit different, but I think it's still is going to work.

It is a rare background. Into college.

I think it'll work.

I think it'll work pretty well because I think we've got enough sponsorships between all of you guys.

I don't have a sponsorship.

I've just I've repeated grades and shit. On a different schools.

I'm just playing here and was like the foreign exchange student.

I do think we need to get a little bit better.

I feel bad I remember speaking of some of the thought here but I feel like M member was boning in a little bit of these combat stuff.

We just got to be at this is for everyone just like remember that we're playing to a podcast so what's on the screen doesn't I'm but I can do better.

I think we're learning and we still there's a part of that's like I don't want to use maps but I also get like like they help you guys out so I don't get rid of them yeah and it also in a way kind of saves you from just like you know if like you describe something you don't necessarily want to describe every little detail. But I like like you can simplify things I't know I've been listening listening to a lot of not another DD podcast and they are really good at theater the mind combat but they rule of cool a lot and have like like big dialogue breaks during combat and stuff like that yeah and that's just not our play style a little bit of dialogue good in combat but I think they definitely push it a bit've always said we' more dialogue breaks in a combat and we are a no combat anyway yeah well I think it does come down to the fact that it's not a minute terms it's six seconds yeah and in in this case theemy can't meaningfully talk to us so well he can speak undercom and he can he's got telepathy if you're expected by his I just as well I didn't about that now you' here you and you Liz and would all have pretty good and skills every time your I'm Paul and touching I think intimation but it might be diplomacy and one being intimation aris Yeah cool um yes well I's I love right now I am not trained in intimidation I will become so but like that the the focus is then probably diplomacy first yeah and I think so it almost like it's sort of part of right but like someone needs to have be probably two people having you need a c crafting is good like all the schools are good like um like you pretty much want someone with all knowledge.

I'm kind of surprised no one did a knowledge check on that guy but I think that's like you just it's a bit of a learning code with that like sometimes it's just really good to do an oledge check really early on whereas in DMD, you just want to lay on the damage real quick.

I'm very um action starved, so it's really hard for me to fit one in. Especially my first round because I've got to get up my cascade and all that shit.

Sorry Paul, what you think?

I was gonna say yeah I'm usually on my first round going do courageous and something um and then the second round if if it lingers the knowledge check or whatever is kind of the most obvious thing to do. , but if you had a knowledge you might have known that hadner I didn't if you had done it would have . Wouldn't have to think.

You're gonna have to do an knowledge check to figure out what the fuck's going on with this poison that two people are affected by. Saying you'll have to figure it out because know that two of you are affected by the poison.

That's all you know right now.

Also this reminds me of the Wow, is it relevant?

Couldn't do anything.

It could make it worse.

I got a letter antidote and a less and a minor are they likem or did you buy them?

Bought them.

I've healing that I bought reminded me of the episode that I believe is the next episode that comes out you guys were like being to Lizzie for trying to use talk talk animals to speak to a mushroom dude.

And then like immediately afterwards you're like you're like yeah, you to plants and Phil made it work, I would never have made that work.

I'd be like, no, that also doesn't work.

Look it up, they're not plants.

They' neither.

It's the fungus.

Yeah, it's a fungus.

It's not a flat.

And then out world, it was a plant.

Yeah.

Like after making such a big deal of talking to animals not working, I was like there's no way you're gonna let this slide, right?

But I think it would work on.

I think yes, technically they're not a plant, but fun if it didn't. You just have to kill it then you can speak with dead.

Yeah, I still haven't released that episode from this week, um so I need to up I'm I'm team to finish getting them out and move on to the past episodes.

Are you still like what ahead on the edits or do you need to play a bit of catch up?

I need to restart doing not really catch up at this point.

I am ahead, but I need to remain ahead.

That's.

I still really appreciate it. 's. Get out of here.

I think that episode is definitely going to be our longest.

I think even after edits that will still be an hour and a half long episode, but I suppose we covered a lot.

We did but you kind of have to because we haven't like we had a quarry in the party now.s here
