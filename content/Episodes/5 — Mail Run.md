# Raw Transcript

So last episode, we started with the cohort in the immediate aftermath of the fight with the myceloid.

Within a minute of being exposed to the poisonous spores, Uiana took some poison damage and suffering some ongoing effects from the poison.

Our resident alchemist Leanna identified the poison as purple pox, and in another 24 hours, the next stage would them would begin, and which would involve them being compelled to seek out a micoloid colony.

Got it right that time. With this knowledge, curing the poison became the top priority for our student crew, so they immediately made their way back to the school after gathering into acquired mushrooms and after finding a few loose treasures stashed in the tree, well, I say loose treasures, they were stashed Anyway, they were stashed in the tree that must have obviously buy the mushroom person. They identified them on the return trip back to the Nagambia and turned out to be some distant basic magical items, which you added to your stashes.

Then you sort out Takal O when you got back from school, who took you to Billy Zufo, who was one of the better drool healers on campus at the time.

Unfortunately due to some other poison outbreaks that had happened that day.

Billy hadn't been fully prepared for multiple outbreaks, had only limited resources able to cure it.

And after some failed counteraction checks, the magic appeared to be unsuccessful.

But I managed to reset the clock a little bit by setting it back to a prior stage, but at least give you 24 hours and then they give you enough time to complete your daily assignment.

So with nothing else better to do, you went back to your task and started looking for some lucky bones.

I think you went to the kitchens first and you were put onto a nearby butcher where you went and were told you could have some bones after about an hour's weight.

During this time, you made use of the you decided to squeeze the mushrooms to get your scarlet cap oil and after an hour, you got your bones, head back to campus to finish making your oils.

Leanna had been preparing her alchemist tools, um while you' been getting the bones, so you were able to successfully make that oil, the caterpillars, you just crushed them up and make a nice oil out of them and with all three oils, you met with the other students to complete the ritual where Ukku served as the primary caster with the rest of the group lending their skills to aid the ritual with a solid success.

But um you're basically taking the full data complete, so you have a short evening and then you'll rest and then it's back to your next task tomorrow. One thing I probably forgot like Ukku andiano, I wonder if you were rolling with your stupefied conditions affecting you yesterday, because I think that does affect your casting.

Yeah, I think it's like a minus one or something like that and yeah, it's not the end of the world.

I think it's one to like will save DCs.

In exhaustion, I think played a part of it too.

Also, any time you attempt to cost the spell well stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a DC 5 plus stupefied value check.

Yeah, I don't that rituals I suppose a ritual is a spell anyway, we didn't do those checks, but um you are still stupefied until you can cure the poison, so stupefied one, which yeah, there is a DC fire flat check, which is just a roller roller D 20 if you get above five, um well, actually if you get above six because you're stupefied by who is one, so it's above six.

Um, it also minus one penalty to your intelligence wisdom and charis checks and DC, including will saving throws, spellch modifiers, spell dC, and skill check that use those attribute modifiers.

But hopefully it doesn't last too much long.

But yeah, so if there's anything you want to do in the evening, you can you don't have a lot of time, but I'm assuming, you know, you eat, your breast, you wash up but you can insert extra thing there or if you want to. Um otherwise, who's taking the trial tomorrow?

Uh, you're told that the emerald bows.

Yeah, sounds good. . Started getting up in the morning, uh, like, what do you guys like you guys are spending a few days here, like what are your wardrobes look like when you're like getting dressed in the morning?

I'm just curious, like paint a paint a picture.

Leanna wears a lot of purples and greens and golds.

It's what she's comfortable in.

So, um chased to wear like a bit of a pants suit if you get like a not like a pen suit like p pants and blouse to have a like outfit classic pantaloons yeah pants with like a green top?

Oh, purple and green is meshed in everything.

We would like golden hues. Like the so yeah she's kind of fashionable, but yeah, but it depends on what you could perceive as being fashionable as well. Anyone else a picture of what they'ed as a little bit like I would probably be most days just that we're just doing simple stuff.

I'd just be wearing wearing common clothes, maybe maybe loose fitting so I can move around at them quite easily. Um and then while while add venturing, I've got a explorers outffit that I'd be wearing, which is kind of just like a nice jacket, gold trim blue jacket. And, um, yeah, just kind of fancy looking, but not terribly crazy.

Yeah. Uh, I think I heard you say you were had an idea?

Yeah, so Corey tends to get around in blues and whites with a little bit of bronze accenting to it. Um if she's adventuring, uh it's a light armor, yeah, it's something more leathery.

Not very fond of shoes, given that, you know, she has wicked talons on her feet.

Not short to the childrenld, but very much practical and easy to move around in most of the time, sort of a tunic style with like a white tabet in the front.

What about you who wants to get first member or Paul?

Well, is pretty simple.

He's just a farmer so it just be like a simple white tunic, maybe brown, like pants, solid leather shoes.

Could you could have like leather arm that is like leather overalls could, but I don't need to obviously I have magical armor that I Yeah, but generally pretty simple um farmer clothes.

Correct.

He's very unuming until he suits up.

Then he looks like a fully armored knight, except that like you know, it is the wood instead of um yeah, instead of a metal.

Gemically, but still nice thing. This is practical for advent and going to nice jacket but it's probably well worn yeah like there's probably a few sides of repairs like I try and keep it in good nick but it's not very very fastidious does not like getting Finn looking this morning I think Finninn this morning he's chosen his uh his yellow t-shirt with a not t-shirt sorry his yellow shirt with a a bright red vest on top and then his purple overcoat so that's kind of the normal vibe basically as loud as possible looking in his wardrobe, he's got quite the collection of crovats, but he hasn't really found the opportunity to use them yet in his ensemble.

It doesn't feel like the opportunity has arisen here yet. Anyone that wasn't in the path by the unsenomes basically forever as a lot of that correct There's a bit more than that they are but they are if they get bored they go cool So um you guys have I'm assuming you you got up you have breakfast and you put on all your clothes um get ready to you once you' you go to the middle of the hallway the agreed upon time probably like eight in the morning maybe even like seven early starts here theambia um and you're greeted by ignas and um and Ignasi greet you saying oh good morning uh looking especially sharp this morning ladies um and I love the color scheme this morning Pho and he greetets you with a smile you've nooubt gathered we' here to task you with your assignment for the day, our ever thoughtful colleague Essie suggested that each of us petitioning to join the five different branches of Mambia take turns in requesting your assistance. Strands of glowing dawns anyway and I are hoping to become a part of the emerald bows.

Our field of study is the world as it is.

We study the communities, people and events of the present day, if you will.

There are some people who feel that simple observation and investigation make us thegambia spies, but that misses the point entirely. Today I'd like you to help us deliver the mail as you says as you produces a basket filled with letters and parcels.

It's not a flashy task, but it's finally important to the members of the local communities.

If you find you have time to listen, people are often willing to share news with those engaged in crucial public service, as anyway adds many many many recipients are far outside Nantampoo, so I have rented elephant birds for you to ride for the day as she looks over to the large silk sacks bulging with food and odd looking creams.

I have also packed you stacks for the chips, um hot coffee, spare umbrellas, dry towels, fresh socks, muscle boms.

She suddenly stops pulling a toy elephant covered in sticky webs out of one of the bags.

Sorry, one of my cheese in was it was eager help pack Indeed.

Well, it looks like you've all done a great job of packing.

This is quite the quite the package for us to head offers.

It sounds like fun.

It was nice I enjoyed packing a nice care package for you.

I'm getting better at it these days.

It was probably going to be a long day.

This is a even for five of you this will be a big job.

Of course.

I'm I'm up for it but , you guys are you guys okay with today?

Yeah, I'm fine with today.

I mean feeling a little bit but I'm I'm still function. You can get started with sorting and then send those two off to Billy, Billy Zufo and then hopefully it won't take too long to get this all sorted Of course in, yes, we will get started upon the task.

Thank you.

Here's a map This is just general idea that but I know, you know the city pretty well, but the rest of you might need a bit of a hand with it.

It's it's a pretty basic map but it should help a bit.

I'm not actually gonna give you guys a map.

It's just a general map of the city that will like help you get around a little bit so you can deliver some of these addresses.

I could just as basic street names.

I don't have the actual resource at hand.

It's not going to be critical for.

That's that's okay.

I don't need a map.

I know my writer play around the town.

No, I need a detailed map with streets intersections. Every little detail, even pedestrian crossings.

This is a request to the DM.

Don't, don't worry, I got it all up here and I tapped my head.

But what if something you?

I mean we can'tiant on you we could take this moment to Is it in the bag so it's a big It's like it's like.

It's like a four foot deep, big like basket with like two big handles just full of packages and letters.

It's like just overflowing just a little bit but not like yeah. Take some time to organize this?

Yeah, that's part of the job.

Like if you have any questions, like let us know we'll be floating around for some of the day before we get to our classes, but yeah, sorting through it using the map that it's all part of the task getting to know the Gambia and the Nantamboo.

Well then it's get started, I think.

Now who's whose room is the cleanest that we can sort this mail?

My room's the biggest.

Do you mind us sorting there so we're out of the way of the rest of the mates?

I'm cool with it. Okay.

And let's head to Leo's room and do a bit of sorting and rap figure it out.

Yeah.

Yeah, that that seemed to go you can basically start it out and just start sorting.

Look the sorting with five of you doesn't take a huge amount of time. Um probably like about half an hour. Um there like the most of these letters were just are actually pretty standard. Um you can figure out like with your knowledge of the um and tamboo Phenic and the map, uh, most of these like probably get them done in a couple of hours. Um but there are some some of these are a bit more problematic. Um Five, uh there's five letters um that the handwriting of the addresses on them are just illegible.

It'll take sometime to decipher these and figure out where they're going to go. Four these are actually decently sized partels parcels, but they're just vague directions.

One says Chukwu, who lives up up the road from the creek. And another one says, you knowubasu, his mother's I am from Abuel, but he's from the city grew up in Ayosa and moved when he got married with lives with his in laws now as many children and seven dogs and an nostrich and four cats, which I told him will still his baby's breath, but he won't listen.

He has a surantosra in front of his house, but half the wave's head fell off, and it looks like a lump now. What A shrine to Godre in front of his cat, but half the wave's head fell off.

This is like all scrawled on like one side of this like box basically. Um and there's a couple more like there's one that says uh to Sandy in the shack 20 minutes from the western bridge entrance and another one to Tanva lives in the canal boat with the rooster on the bow. That's bow, right?

Hom hom problem homophones that is a letter to parcel delive . Maybe it is.

It would appear to be there's there's the letter addressed to us.

I's a solid step back.

Hey, can I ever recall knowledge about the right of terrorism in Mambio?

Ou takes this opportunity to put on his arm and then go take the letter.

Fully humbered and channeling his elements, he will open the letter. The letter and reads the stupidambia parcel deliver Where is my package'll go to where it was to go. Dress did not make it to where it has not dress ah the the lamp is not where it should be.

Where is it?

You better find it and get it to my niece. Um and it goes on like this getting angri and angrier and it seems to be a tirade about a um some sort of a stained glass lamp um that um uh was not did not go to where it was supposed to go.

Now what would this uh unhinged roundter perhaps have sent a return address on that or is he further furthering his own problems?

There is a return on it but it's on any of the packages we have there's not the descriptive ones there is no return address.

But yeah. More more in the ones that the same.

Yeah, exactly.

They said this, maybe it's one of these packages.

Oh no, like the street where the package was meant to go is meant like the address where the package was meant to go is mentioned. And itbs it as you read through it uh uh this person's I said is a granddaughter in Dedi, um did not get a package that was meant for them. And there is an address for in Dedee.

And then there's three more letters um uh and uh these are all addressed to like one word names. Uh Why don't people give me a religion check the people that found the people that want to for these letters?

Yep, I do that. No, I take it these ones.

There is a 14 on the dice with a plus foreign religion for a total of 18.

Okay, um so yeah, you all pretty well so you notice one letter is dressed to someone Godre. Um and you as you were just talking about with the descriptive address, that is a god. Um and but you know that they are the d of wind and weather. But the address, um but there's like a little bit of scrawling it says, um it says please tie to a kite and one tie in the air release it.

And there's another snatched one up.

It's extremely bright.

I have an idea how can this.

There is a second one that is addressed to is and says this will be sent when five bells are cast on it simultaneously. Essentially in the same round.s. Five stones.

And then it says, I expect this will destroy the letter, but it will reach its destination. And then there is a third letter which is addressed to Mlud.m I'm probably butchering this pronunciation.

It's MA Z, L U D E H.

They're the imperial uh with that religion A again, you know, they're the imperial lord of stewardship community and snakes.

Maybe you know that, Le, you'd probably have a bit of a connection to snakes as well.

And in the instructions are on the enclosed message, um you must transcribe uh it's it's basically a short message that a new canal should be strong and reliable, basically in asking the God, but it must be transcribed onto an egg then fed to a snake. And it sends if the snake refuses to eat, this is a bad omen.

Agory is gonna look at Leon and go, do you count as a snake?

I have an affinity. For snakes.

Do not and unc.

I missed that bit sorry.

So not precisely You're not a snake is what I'm are there snakes that have an affinity you that we could maybe call up?

I don't have the list on me.

I left it at home I don't think okay.

Le's got lots of lots of snake friends over in the the next city over.

We all believe it.

I'm pretty sure we could find a snake easily enough in the jungle.

Indeed.

I don't really want to go in the jungle after what happens yesterday.

I will say that it's raining fairly badly not horrendous like it's it's just gonna be unpleasant being out there all day.

Unfortunately, that's the brakes.

I mean, I feel with maybe maybe Guthrie is us maybe the deity of wind and weather, maybe sending us aignment.

He's a little mad that we haven't already sent the letter to him.

Maybe that should take priority.

Doesn't seem that hard.

I said you had you said you had an idea about that one, didn't you?

Sorry.

There was that that small gentleman who likes to jump off of the tower.

I would suggest that we enlist his aid in such a matter. Makes sense.

Because I't I cannot find my notes with his neck.

I'm looking for his use a gliding. Glider is a type of hydrative way, is it not?

I think in it's I think so, but we have been asked to let go of it, though. He may be able to make a smaller version of his hand glider that we can justss off the tower. Like shoving motion with her hands did you guys want to start on that and think of maybe one of the other difficult ones where you're doing it before we split we might five spells on this this other package while we're together.

So I'll grab that one out of the pile and like separate it out so that we're not destroying everything, um, though that would maybe hasten how completion, uh we probably want to separate that one out.

So everyone have a nice uh low um low collateral damage spell they want to get ready with or do we need to go outside for this one?

I mean most of my one target creature or is that okay if we can custom Phil?

I don't know if it is you don't have anything that can target an item I mean if it's like something like just smashing it like I'll say like if it's a it depends I suppose it like what what spells what do you have?

Gouging chore rare frost produce flame.

I think I'll probably let you gad it I can I can add add into this It probably takes you a little bit of time to sort of set it up in a place where you were not gonna hit each other and with these spells. Um find a place outside where this is gonna be done without worrying anyone.

I can cast guidance on it.

I was guidance on is it's exactly where to go because it's have a plus or whatever to perception of where to go.

Explosives and and vials, so I don't know that's any good.

That's not a spell, but you were you and U who don't have spells per se were given a free can the start.

Do you remember what that was?

Notes I thing that we got that would that's you got if you'm wearing a mum hand on my bit of a monkeys and shield.

I think for shield to work, you gotta be holding that little. Yeah, well everyone else blasts it.

I only one person is blasting it.

Most people are helping send it on its way. That everyone goes off and then Liz Casts shield and then I car gouging claw on itop it in half Yeah, so what what's what's going to do the order order, like a guidance, guidance hand to hint, like to send it over, then she order then gad and claw?

Yeah, I think that sounds good.

I thought you shield first, but I could be wrong.

And then everyone can throw this stuff at it.

Everyone can throw that stuff and I can teleinetic projectile it at you and then you sealed it. Works both ways. Um yeah I'm happy to go with with the majority.

I like the telekinetic projectile, so yeah, it takes you a little bit longer as you guys are coming up with the perfect plan to do this.

I do like the telekinetic projectile. Like it being done it.

Maybe you telekinetic projectile it to Laurie, who gadge and closet, like it like a slam dunk.

Yeah, that's how the mechanics like.'ll go with that. Cool.

So all in all it's taking you about an hour of your time so far.

It's about nine.

It's getting close to nine in the morning. And you've dealt with this one letter, but you've also done most of your sorting.

You haven't looked at any of these so just to go over it again, you've got just general deliveries it'll take you about two hours.

You've got these five that you can't read, these four descriptive ones that you'll have to figure out. The one, which is uh, you're going to have to figure out the parcel that went to the wrong address, um and to two more ones for the dies.

One is the kite one and one you got to feed to a snake.

After putting it on an egg. Don't necessarily you weren't told you've got eight hours, you just have to finish this like if it's late it's late. Um uh yeah, so you guys could go to check out it's like it's late enough in the morning now that you could go to Billy Zupo without it being like early, like rude early.

Yeah, yeah.

Just before we do anything else, can I just have a look specifically at those allegible ones and see if any of them look lamp shaped.

No, these are just letters letters packages that are.

If you are trained in society, you could try to decipher the writing.

I'm trained in society. Yeah, decipher writing well society skill and you could do it.

I can tell you right now it's a DC. If you fail, you can like you once you fail, you can't do it for that letter but someone else that you just as me being able to roll for it.

I rolled the 20 so I rolled up 20, which is 23.

So we've got three letters left that we don't know.

And not the two that we've got normal like they're just in the realm of where all of all the letters are going or are they special places? , you just have to keep on doing society checks for these these ones you can't read.

Oh, I meant the ones we already know about, like when you said this too. Like are they just in the pile, like can we sort them off with the regular letters?

Or no, they will like even though you decipd it's still just a tiny bit vague and it'll take a little bit longer than the other ones. You' that these allowed about an extra half hour to the standard the standard ones it'll take two hours.

Cool. So yeah, there's two of those.

So they' got three more you I suppose you at least a society check then, Laurie?

Yeah.

That's one you failed on, but you can try another one.

I might as well try the other two and then others can try rolling them.

Is anyone else trained in society? . Okay.

Let's see how the other option is we can assist.

Not really with these ones.

It's sort of like you read them or you don't get you were for a second one. elveelve total.

Uh, yeah, so there's two that Laurie has not been able to decipher, but um yeah, if there or Paul want to try?

Sorry, Leiano or with Phinnick, I An 11.

T total?

Yeah.

Cool.

You don't know.

So, Leanna, you can you can be the last person trying on this one.

Again, you have hear hero point?

No, I didn't it right.

I'm do it on the Roll that I wrote an 18.

You are able to decipher this one so just remembering your stupied still.

Yeah, true.

So minus one That is not enough to pass.

Do you want to use a hero.

Yes. What you need 12 plus seven minus one, so you need a 12 on the is anyone else trained in society, Oiri or I'm not unfortunately.

I'm trained in perception, astrology, strict law, nature and religion.

I will allow any one of the other two guys to use a hero point to have one last crack.

I'll have a crack trick Maybe we can find someone that can give us a hand.

Yeah, it feels like we should do that before we commit there a stamp asend to send and we can let them do with it the other option would be doing all the other just like friendly just be like you around society intellig unless you're trained in it'll be trained in.

I've got some old ones an old version that I'm working off but it looks like I have marketers trained on the dice you got a chance That is airt on the dice I'm afraid.fortunately yeah so tell me there's one more to to decipher that what I with I thought you with This was the last I'm getting a little bit confused but that's them you'veated one of them one of them is still you still unsure of.

So basically these these take a little they're a little they're just a little bit more vague.

You put these sort of with the other ones and that that whole lot will take four hours or you could send someone to just figure out these ones, uh which will take a couple of hours. Um and then you still have the four descriptive ones that you'll have to figure out somehow like you probably have to gather some information or figure out like how to where these things are or like looking for landmarks and when you when you're out there, um and there's two more d ones, the kite and the snake. And then there's a Mr.ivery.

Even writing down the letter onto the egg will take a little bit of time I take it.

Yeah.

I'll tell you you' local role Where?

I'll set the D for this one at as well.

Well, then there's no suspense, but I got a total of 15.

I will say that you know I' Antab is a big city and you know that there are shrines you think that there are shrines to each of these gods around the town and I'm recalling knowledge and defeat I wonder if this is the right one or the wrong one. Uh and you know that um people do get annoyed to hear and like male gets delivered past midnight because you remember someone getting angry once it came somehow.

All right, yeah, okay, I know one of those is true um yes yeah yeah People will get mad. Um yes, yes yes. So yeah there's a few you might have to ask around for um but yeah, like how you want it's up to you guys or you can just all go ahead out as a group.

Well, um I would be happy to go into town and start delivering a set of them there and maybe get some more information about some of these four ones that we're not quite sure about. Looking for the landmarks and stuff like that.

Yeah.

I'm going to go withandering about jumping off of a very high tower.

So you are you going to stick around and just do that while other people head out to do the other ones?

We can catch up with them. Um yeah, probably. Um Okay, so who do we want to jump to first?

So basically what's everyone else doing?

Is anyone sticking around with Ouri or are you all just going up to do the main delivery?

How much how much extra time does an extra person take off the deliveries?

Like is it more efficient for me to go do the random weird deliveries that we just discovered basically just have like time for each sort of group of deliveries or individual deliveries of how long that will take sometimes you can beat that time sometimes you won't beat that time. You obviously it's like any TTIPG like splitting the party comes with risks they could always be an encounter but you are just delivering the mail.

You don't expect combat.

You're not going far outside the town.

There's there's going to be some rural deliveries.

These descriptive addresses sound pretty rural where like there aren't street names, for example, so yeah, you'll be heading out of the city.

Also, you know that there are more snakes out of the city than in the city unless you can think of somewhere in the city that might have snakes or figure that out from someone. So I would probably it's DM saying I recommend spoon in the party but like you don't have to and you already got kind ofoon in the party but like. Yeah um trying to meet up it might be hard to meet up like after an hour you might it might be worth sort of diving it up a little bit more half a day's worth of deliveries and then meeting up at some point and in and you know, if you have an encounter trust to say that it's not going to be so deadly that it's going to kill someone and you can't run away from it. That fair m I'm trying to give away too much, but I also open the door for possibilities.

I'll probably try and take a matching amount of the more obscure males that we've figured out so far and deliver them. So I'll be on them and they' be doing the normal mail, I guess. Yeah like there's like is there anyone like for example like the descriptive ones they all seem rural like you could like have like a rural team and a city team um it's like rural is it all jungle out there because I do have pretty good jungle jungle yeah I like the immediate outskirts are like still like jungle farms and stuff like yeah So I' stick with that team then.

Yeah, I mean plants are kind of my thing.

I'll probably go as long as well. Um yeah, so the two of you are you going to stick around like are you gonna help Gemma with her cut first and then do then head out and then sort of leave the rest to Phyick and Leanna to do?

I guess it's up to them if they want some help I'm happy to assist, but otherwise I'm very much well getting back into I ask she wants to be whichever team it is they can just stay in if you and go yeah that's cool I say it doesn't seem like you would have a place to help with them. Eatingrit.

How dare you?

How very very.

They like chocolate biscos with like vanilla um cream filling on the inside.

This is the important Yes. My theory is is that I work with Arin to set the uh letter afloat, as it were. Um I can then take one of the other god addressed letters to the local shrine. Um I'm sure someone can give me directions and we could meet back from here for lunch and then I can rejoin one of the two groups I assist with the remainder of the deliveries.

Well maybe if you have a bit of spare time you can try and find out where that last letter is to go to.

Maybe someone around here can read a bit better than us an excellent I can also spend my time searching for a cure for our friends with the those two were just gonna go to Zupo and see if they could just get cured or at least reset.

So I guess we should do that first.

Yeah, or that's the gri that sticks around here for a while while we ignal them.

Well, it sounded like you'll go do that and then maybe Uy just working on her own on the two-day effic letters, um where while uhinnick and Leanna go into town to do the the general deliveries and the unclear directions that have been translated.

The one that hasn't been translated stick that with um Oy as well, that'll be her, then the four parcels that are going into the descriptive ones, they'll be with Oku and screen. Um and then you'll meet back up and figure out the one that went to the wrong street address.

Is that about right?

Yeah.

All right..

Cool.

It feels like we're heading that way and I just summariarised it.

And that's relatively fair.

I think Ori will mostly just hanging around the dorm trying or like trying to figure out these two letters while the rest of you guys do other stuff.

That's yeah, um what are you going to do with these birds are you going to try them out?

So what other?

The elephant birds.

They're about the size of a horse.

They seem quite docile, they're flightless, they're like big rideable emus.

Interesting.

I mean, I'm happy to go to town on a big rideaable in.

Yeah, well I think it'll help for some of the further ones we got them we got to use them.

What do you what kind of checks are we looking at for writing?

it'll 's an animal hand isn't it's. Seem very docile. So like this is not even going to be a train check and you don't think it's gonna be hard.

It's almost like a fat check, but nature will be up.

Well, it doesn't help I don't have it.

Ah, is that no check.

I was just fucking with you.

It's just like like writing ao.

That seems pretty trickyy.

I don't know.

Dodo is a very friendly one thing it doesn't matter..

Um, okay, so, um okay, so let's cut to Billy Zoofa.

Like you guys will say that Uku and Leanna go to Billy Zoofu while the rest of you are sort of bumbling up, um, and then it packages into the respective groups. Um and you guys, what do you guys do when you get there?

This is just Liz andimbo, Leanna and Ukku who are poisoned.

Liz remember being mut, so sorry my conne so I knew I was off with no so you guys are going to Billy Zupo's house to get to try to get cured of the poison first, but you guys are basically who were in front of her door.

What would you like to Knock on the door 's there?

Hi, I'm Leanna.

I always met the other day.

I was wondering if I if you have treatment available so I don't have to have this oh yes. Is the other one with you as well?

yes. . All right, come in, come in, come in.

Close the door behind you. . Okay.

Well, I've prepared a few more.

We have a few more shots at this. Um I have my neutralized poison. Um and hopefully we'll be able to sort this out.

Okay, let me give it a try.

I should know pretty much straight away if this works. , you roll at D20.

He wants to go first.

I'll go.

Writer, uh I'll work my magic and hopefully.

Yes, I think that's done the trick.

I think I've successfully counteracted the poison.

Oh, thank you so much.

How long until like I'm completely back with it fine now. Over here.

You're I mean I feel like we could we could talk.

I'll be interested about your journey as a student.

But after now, let me see if I can cure this poison, we wanna keep you with us.

Uh, yes, uh, it wasn't quite as strong as last time as the the one for Leanna, but I think that will do the trick.

Well, if you need any more healing but hopefully you don't get poisoned again, what what's your task if it's today?

I' hopefully hopefully no poisonous today.

Well run along.

Do you have lollopss every time I go to the doctor or anything of the equivalent they give out lollipops. Lollip.

I have carrots.

I've already got a cat, maybe next time.

Irots. Carrots.

Oh yeah, I'll take one of those.

Thank you, and I'm gonna trade it like a lollipop.

Weird, okay.

She is weird.

I have many of the world a bit weird here and the Gambia, we've got to try new things. Um she's still sucking on the car.

There's are for crunching not for sucking.

That's my new favorite cereal. Um it's that comes with a choking warning. Um Anyway, so yeah, you got a cured of your poison with a successful counteract checks and sent back on your way. Um So we have uminnick and Leanna mounting up on their elephant birds with the bulk of the letters and packages, but these are just for these to just throw around town.

They shouldn't be too hard to live.

They'll just take time to go through the streets.

Now you think you'll take about four hours to do all these?

However long it takes.

Yeah, um and Uku yeah, Ukku and Skri, you have four bigger packages um with a variety of haphazard um packaging to make them up. Um that the rural packages um so that you think that you you're hoping that you can get each done in about an hour, um but you might have to ask around and figure out where they are.

And then we've got um we have uh Oiri with just three letters, one that you can't no one has been able to decipher. Um and two with um address the gods one involveving a kite. Um who do we want to do first?

I'm I'm sorry to say this umin and um Pin in thena, you you just do your deliveries.

It's not particularly exciting. Um Mostly it's just popping letter and yeah, they get this polite yeah, yeah, yeah.

And surely we can look around town and try and find a lollipop for Triana.

Well, I You don't get any lollipops. Um you put well you probably get a couple of like sweet treats of some vendors. Um so I will say okay, there's a bit more okay.

You deliver one letter toinas.

This is one of the unclear, the ones you have to decipher. Um and she says ah my niece's wedding invitation. Uh should be a good day. Uh you you guys go to many weddings?

Not lately.

Have you got a dress yet?

I have to make the bride dress a beautiful gold embroidered number. Sounds fancy.

I don't normally do big work like this, but you know, for my niece for her big day, of course. You do anything to family?

Yes. Make a nice dress to yourself too.

Oh, I can't upstage her, though.

It just something not gold, maybe something a bit more subdued.

Maybe you purple like your friend here.

Purple's a great color.

It's the color of royalty.

Oh, one of them anyway.

Yeah, you chat to her for a little bit longer. Um Another one of the one another one of these ones you deciphered took you out to um the edge of town where you met a meet a woman named Igo. Um and she um is basically running a bird rehabilitation sanctuary uh and she just rehabilitates into jungle birds for releasing them back into the wild. Um Hi that's all right no it's not high no it would be a D20 but I only rolled a 20 so that's she does not offer you a free bird that can't be released into the world.

I'm and then another person you get you meet masuba mubu um uh these names will not matter if they will if I forceced them to.

But uh but this guy is a um like he has he's a bit of a dog uh a dog breeder um and or dog rescue bit more of really um and he meets you meet his newest puppy who he found stuck up a tree. Um and uh at the sort of towards the end, um there's a man named Jetto um and you get a jar of jam.

He he said oh, just make I've made too much of this jam please please thank you for the letter.

Oh wow, well thank you for the job.

I can't wait to try it.

It's Mulberry.

Mulbury's a very seasonal.

You have to make all this jam at once, so hopefully you enjoy.

That's actually a true fact about Mulberry jam.

M Mberry is only fruit for a little bit so you just gotta turn it all in a jam or risk losing true fact is very I thoughtllip. Eat it I don't rest of the guys eat half pound of jam each on your way home. Um and deal with that we'll have to deal with that later. Um but we will come to um let's cut to uh the jungle fellas, Skrin and uku.

How are you guys going about um like you guys yeah, you've got sort of general landmarks to look out for or to ask people about or to go about if you have any other ideas of how to find them?

Well, one was quite specific.

Well, actually two are fairly specific. Um on that map that we had were there any creeks drawn in? 'sambu is a river city and it's basically manicured so there's like canals and rivers running through the city.

So as I said, one of these isn't rural.

One of these is just like is a guy on a canal boat.

One of these is like Shaq uh shq just outside the western bridge entrance. And then you got the one chucku who lives up the road from the creek.

There's several creeks.

You're not sure which creek.

Yeah, so that one Western that kind of sounds the most specific at least.

Yeah, and then the canal one doors are pretty specific. , you got a would give them to me in the book and two of them I had to come up with.

Uh, yeah, so how would you guys like to go about finding them?

I'd say head to the western one first while trying to keep an eye out for the canal boat while we're going.

If we see him, we see him if we don't we don't.

Okay. Um okay, so um you head out to the west.

It's going to take you sort of the better part of an hour to get there like it's like you're in the middle of the city.

This is like out like sort of 20 minutes past the exit um just getting it like on the outskirts of the city so you can start heading there. Um give me both of you well one of you can give me a DC20 flat check to see if you on this owl on walk you get lucky to find this booked. Check it's for this as well.

This is just like you're getting lucky. Uh you do not.

It was uh you needed a sixteen plus that's just to like happen across this boat with a rooster on the boat now.

And I take it we didn't see the the one with the religious thing out front either.

No no but yeah it's taking you um just about about an hour and you're sort of out in the schedule now I suppose you heading back in um so um but why don't you give me a survival check for like for each one I suppose you haven't um you sort of been you' sort of been stomping around the Western side of the meetings.

So yeah, give me a survival give me three survival checks each, I suppose.

Okay, and Uku, you give me three you can give me three survival checks. Only only two to be fair.

Laurie succeeded on one.

Well, the first two are doing pretty well survival don't have survival flat rolls, I don't what's 17+2+19+1 so you guys are sort of going up and down going up and down higher ground.

It takes you a while after the first one for an hour, you're stomping around a lot, um just like looking around for these things.

Eventually you see like a creek that looks like um there's like a road and it's like that could be it.

You start going down like you start like laughing up a chucku um and like, oh, you mean chucku's chai and like you find like this sort of like little chai shop uh by um the canal, um run by chuckwu, um and you basically deliver him like a package of like fancy tea from something else.

And he's like, oh, thank you so much.

How's you doing fun in the place?

Look a little bit, but we're here.

So it wasn't too bad.

If you have any idea, my cousin, like he's never actually been here, so I just described my I don't know.

If you have any tips on like a better way to describe it, let me know.

Sure.

What road do you live on?

We don't doesn't have a name.

Canal Road?

What direction does it from town?

It sort of like northwestern, but like more western and then like you go Via north, so northwestern.

Yeah, well you could think that might help.

Maybe even including which gate to leave the city from?

Well, that these are all good tips. Would you like a chai for for the service?

I'm pretty sure here would love that too.

It is like it's raining out in this rain for two hours now just stomping around trying to you delivered two parcels after two hours.

So yeah, a nice hot ch sounds pretty good. And while you're doing this you get chatting and you're sort of looking around and you start talking about the Gra shrine, even though you roll at a Bible like the other way to do this was diplomacy.

So you sort of use theival like like the Gra shrine.

I think I saw something that way and it's like, yeah, that one and you get directions for a third one there. Um and so that's the one that has you know Mubasu, his mother's in from Abuela, but he's from the C, grew up in Ayosa and moved when he got married lives with his in laws now, has many children and seven dogs and an ostrich and four cats.

Well I told him which I told him was still his baby's breath, but he won't listen, he has a round to go Gosra in front of his house, but half the wave's head fell off and it looks like a lump now.

So you were chatting about that one with chuck?

Yeah, probably saying look at look your description wasn't the worst we had.

This is this is probably the most suspect. Yeah, this is the tricky one.

I think, yeah, if you go back and sort of viewer around all the way to the south, I think that's I think that might be the way to go with this one.

I don't get that that way much.

I'm in the northwest.

But I think check out the south side.

Perfect, thank you.

And so with that information and with thisival check, it takes you another hour to deliver this big oddly wrapped package. Um Actually, while I'm there. Um before we leave, I'd ask, oh, how much for a bag of try?

Um, one silver. Perfect.

This will keep me going for a little bit.

It' delicious, thank you.

I think that one silver is like, you know, like 20 doses of try.

I think yeah, you'll need to need to add the hot water, but yeah. It doesn't have anything mechanical effect.

It's just a pleasant drink.

And then for the last one, the river river canal boat, will say that yeah, on the way back. You're sort of looking around the canal and eventually you sort of get to some higher ground and you spot them.

And you yeah, it takes you it takes you a bit over four hours to deliver all of these ones and get back to the school, but that means you're getting back about the same time as everyone else anyway.

Now we will cut over to our solo friend Oiri.

How do you want to proceed?

You've got three letters in your hands.

First time I'm going to look for my hand gliding Fred.

Hey What did we call last time? . 49. . Give me an intelligence.

I don't like my chances there. Heard this information. Recently, and it was specifically directed to you.

The DC is not super hard. 13 on the dice is fine unless you even with aice from the was you know it's the the northwestern spire um that he told you has the gravity effect.

He just said that if you jump you can basically get like a 60 feet of air. Then I make way towards the northwestern spire and I do it in a very comfortably clippy pace.m I'm moving.

Yeah, it's easy.

It is raining pretty badly.

You can get in there and you can jump. Um Basically if you're within 15 feet of it, you can high jump and get up to 60 feet without an athletic check or anything and you land without falling damage.

I have any Is there any paper around?

Like you're school. Uh you can definitely find oh that's have I've you a bunch of papers right back that I got and part of it was paper.

So um I'm going to hastily um put together like even if I have to kind of pull a couple of my own feathers out and like stick it to like poke them through it so like there's a cross pattern, um I'm gonna stick the letter uh to the outside of the piece of paper on the feathers, um maybe yank out a couple of pieces of my own hair, ti it to it in like a very very thinraid like a string, hold it my hand.

Take a few steps back.

Okay, we're doing this.

We're doing this in a rain storm.

Fantastic.

There' no help me and quar takes a running leap off the tower.

Well, first, I'm gonna make you need you to make me a crafting check if you just crafted a thing. 14 on the dice.

Okay, yeah, you're able to it's pretty shoddy.

It's mostly bits it's like half bits of you with some paper and a couple of twigs that you found that weren't fully sodden and wet.

It's a pretty shoddy kite. You think it might hold It's taking a little bit of time to cobble this together, find all the stuff.

Okay, and now, yeah, it is pretty rainy.

It's not a good day for kite flying.

So basically yeah, you're gonna have to give me an athletics or a slide of hand check to get this thing up in the air properly.

I tell you what I'm gonna give you a circumstance bonus just because you're using the spire because that was a bit of information you ged on. It's it's on the d plus from my athletics for 13 one would be a 14. That is there and you to release you fall down and you see the kite just falling down with you.

It didn't get released into the air. But it is not a failure.

You can try again like brushing off all this water like shaking my wings out in frustration all right let's try this again.

Come on you piece of paper and yeah, back up a little bit further this time.

I can do this.

I can do this up the tower again.

Yeah. Give me another athletics or slide of hand check.

Oh, that's better.

That's a 16 on the dice.

Okay, and what was your plus?

Uh, two Okay, the was 17.

So you your second try, you get up there, you cut the thing and release it and it flies away into the distance.

If you would cry failed, it was going to get struck by lightning and destroyed.

It was fully ready for that to be a consequence.

Just the going just a standing on the ground like a wing over her head watching it sail off, sort of salutes it.

What's speed to you little friend?

I better get it out of this rain.

Otherwise I'm going to get a cold. 's taking you about an hour like fig and finding jumping up there and you have more letters that you took responsibility for I'm going to take a little bit of time to dry myself off because jumping off of a tower in the middle of the rain's not been quite fun and I'm pouring water out of my shoes but after about half an hour, I reckon to just kind of clean up a little bit going to try and find the shrine of one you can't decipher and you've got one that needs to go to mud which needs to be transcribed onto an egg and then fed to a snake. To eat it, that is a bad.

Okay, I'm going to stop by the kitchens first of all to see whether or not I can have an egg.

What do you ask at the kitchen?

I bowel politely and say, my fellow students and I have working towards completing the task of delivering the mail.

And one of them is required to be delivered tos Luda.

Um, but for that it requires an egg to be swallowed by a snake.

Uh, I am without both egg and snake at the moment.

I am hoping at least you can help me with the phone.

Yes, in go to the shrine.

They have eggs there. They have snakes and eggs there. . Okay. Should be fine.

They should they like you might have to pay like a little bit to as like to the egg as like an offering.

But yeah I have I don't worship them myself, but I know people do do.

Oh, uh excellent. Might I have some directions?

I think it there in the northwest some northeast somewhere actually northeast.

Thank you very much for your time.

And theory will head off to Mud's trying. Yeah easy uh it takes you there.

It takes you about 20 minutes or so to get there. Um um and when you get there, it's like it's not a particularly big building, but it's a small sort of temple with a shrine um yeah like you know there's priests hang around and yeah, what do you do when you get in there?

I look for a a priest or a worshiper who's closest to the entrance who seems to be a grit of sort um I tuck my hands at my back.

I bow respectfully will met.

Can I help you?

Uh, I believe so.

I have been sent to deliver a a letter on behalf of a petitioner of to me.

No one has to me in many years.

Um, it's from a petitioner, your Grace, um, it is indeed for the deity themselves.

I believe that it needs to be transcribed upon an egg and swallowed by a snake, and unfortunately I seem to be without both egg and snake, but I do have the means to donate to your your shrine and um as such, if you could assist me with this task I would be have recently and the snakes may not be very hungry.

You may not be able to find a hungry snake. Straight, very very prim, very proper wings 's walking around. She's very, very proper as aory.

She sent somebody else's temple.

This is not her goddess's temple.

She is going to be on her best behavior and represent the desens very well. Very well and hand me a silver.

Corey pulls out in fact two silas and hands them both over for your trouble, your grace.ail I shall keep an eye and pray for your offering.

It is most kind of you need tocribe a message it's that a new canal wall will be strong and relable on aail.be butkes in your egg.

You're going to need to roll me a naked check or something or come up with something else for me find a hungry snake identify a hungry snake.

I have an idea whether or not this is going to work.

I don't Let me just double check so my my thought is is that a quarry is well very prim and proper. Bit of a scary woman when she wants to be so the plan is to grab one of the snakes around the throat, pull it to her face and go now listen you scaly git. You're gonna swallow this egg and give it to your goddess. You do have this elderly priest standing right to you so you're welcome to do that he would see just wait till heves?

He does not seem to be leaving. Can't really use deception.

All right.

We'll try with the nature check first because I've still got a plus five in that and if that doesn't work, absolutely going to tell the snake it's a scalyit.

Nature level one is good solid plus.

Oh, okay, that's yeah, yeah, you try to give this like snake show up and have a fight about it.

Um, and then you end up this one snake eats the egg and then another snake eats the snake that eat the egg um, and give me a religion check. Okay so for religion I have a five as well.

It was a bit low, but yeah.

And it's a 14+5 is a total of 19. You know omens and this is one hell of an omen. Like the snake ended up like it's like like the snakes ended up sort of eating each other's tails in like a weird thing and it's like this is like a hell of an moment.

I Corey kind of sees this happen and looks around her and sees the sympology of Mel Luda around and go goes okay.

I'll take that as a yes.

But you also know that you also like this could have been a freak occurrence because these were two hungry snakes in a sea of welfare snakes that were really trying to find their next meal and they were starting a off each snakes anyway.

I am not going to pass up on.

Yeah, and that's how omens work anyway. They can be coincidence or can be omens you about two hours so you still have the two letters miss you still have one't have been able to decipher but you are sort of at a temple right now it's not the busiest part of town but there's people around there's there's things you could do what would you like to do pass it over to one of the other if they've anything to clear up just because we've spent a lot of time on my side of things at the moment they've done they've taken about four hours each to so you've already tried the society so you can just sort of around that's sort of you have so I'm assuming that the way that this city is designed is that the area that I'm in at the moment is basically full of temples for different deities. This city is a bit there's temples all over the place but there's different there are other temples around.

Okay. Um so I might spend some time going from temple to temple asking if anybody recognizes the handwriting or there's symbology on the letter that might drump out at anybody. Aimacykeykey.

Gather information. 's with a shot.

I've got a plus four inipluency.

Come on.

That's a 12 on the dice with a plus four so it' be a total of 16.

Okay, yeah, so it takes you about in half an hour to find someone that can help you and then another half hour to deliver the letter but they do eventually you do find someone that sort of recognizes sc and you're to deliver the letter and you actually end up getting back a little bit before everyone else, but you the least amount of letters everyone else shows up at the d did you guys actually finish the entire jar of jam?

Yeah we got stomach aches.

We got jam around our faces and you see like an empty preservative jar.

I could have you had like scones with Mul jam and if you'd just been patient. You have one letter which is the letter that is that I from the angry grandmother about the misdelivered package.

I feel like we've got time to resolve this, so yeah, what do you guys want to do?

Or do you guys want to end it here and we'll sort this out next session?

Have too long.

There's a little bit more to this one than the other ones.

But yeah, I say we do it.

Let's go. What do you okay, so what do you wanna do?

You've got a you give given a street that that this an address where this package did not really go to like a proper address like numb street?

Yes. We know the address didn't go to, so we just have to check all the other addresses.

It must be in one of those, right?

Any better ideas?

Potential to I mean like any with a smudge, anything could look like anything, right?

Like it was a six, could have been an eight or something like that. Um it could have been like a one. Know So it's a single digit?

Uh, no, it's not dig. Like it's like it says, uh yeah, it was like 16 something, 16 fucking jungle lane. Looking at the map, how big is Jungle Lane?

Big enough.

It is the Jungle Road, Jungle crescent. 'sungle jungle lane. Um there's actually more than one jungle lane in fact as you're looking deeper in this map like like it's one of those ones there's like there's like Jungle Lane and then like little jungle lane and there like they could have been that could all be part of it as well.

There is a jungle and they both come like come up jungle street and at the at the very end there's a junglegle crescent and there's also a jungle avenue that you guys know about, there's not many residential things on Jungle Avenue. Still there's few places to start any other ideas oh really um because the thing of note is the thing we don't have So we're not getting any clues from what we've got because they don't know where it's left or it's been.

Could we oh it doesn't specify how long ago they sent the letter or the package rather?

Says um like like a like yeah, like like like yeah, like it says like two weeks ago, um which is probably like three or four weeks ago based on let it delivery time.

Could we we could also find out who delivered it Yeah, you could ask you could ask you could look around the in you could like look very agnostic or anyway.

Yeah, that seems like a good idea.

Maybe there's also like a storage or something maybe it hasn't been delivered at all.

Yeah.

What do we think?

You't goneways's room, um and you see her in there with her two kids, Xante and I can't remember the other one's name, but she has another kid. And they're just hanging around.

She's like, uh get behave children, behave, we have guests.

Um and they sort of look sneaky, like they've um like they've also been sneaking jam. Um oh yes, how's the mail delivery going?

Are you all done?

I's done, but with tummy eggs. Would you like would you would you like some hot ginger beer?

If you're offering, um I was I was just making up for the rain.

I can get you all a mug. You all you're all done, you said?

No, no, not quite I'm it's like we sent all the letters that we got, but then one of the letters was addressed to us. So I mean it's a bit complicated but I think that it's he seemed kind of mad um about a lamp that hadn't been delivered.

And we were just wondering, like, do you think do you guys have any packages that you haven't delivered?

Is there a storage place for those?

No, we don't delivered everything. We always make sure everything's delivered at least within the week. Do you have any any address or anything?

I?

Yeah.

I don't remember this.

I do deliver the mail sometimes, but I don't remember this one.

I think I would just it is it's your responsibility to get with someone else's day. Um so this is all part of the time.

You still have a couple left at daylight, so I think you'll just have to start.

I would just go to the address and see what information you can find and hopefully they might be able to point you in the right direction or just start door knocking around places.

I don't know.

Uh Yeah, if you if you're still struggling in a couple of hours, maybe I'll be able to have some more ideas.

Oh, hopefully, because I've I've heard people get pretty mad if they don't get their letters delivered by midnight, so you ought to get on this. , not only I mean, people are pretty happy to receive a letter at any time of the day.

I mean, get very often. , look, I agree to disagree.

I'm pretty sure we gotta get this done quick..reed to disagree?

It's fine.

But still, that's that's time for someere, I think. Thank you, by the way. Yeah, you don't give it a mug of hot ginger beer that is actually in the book.

Although you're not supposed to you're not supposed to get it until you're fully done with deliveries, but it felt like the right time. So yeah, you've been told probably just to head to the address and to figure out what would you like to do the address. Figure it out.

Yeah, I think we can all do that together.

Right.

Agreed.

Sure. Uh you go knock on the door of the address and a woman uh opens the door.

She's um got a babe, I got it on her back and she says, uh yes, what is it?

We're investigating a potential lost piece of bail that you might have been expecting.

Is that the Mali lamp?

You're here to fix this up?

You need to convince this woman that I want my wife back.

It's not hers you know where it was delivered to my next door neighbor lives lives in I live in 16.

Yes, well we've got this letter from your relatives and I know that we can convince her.

Ah, my grandmother got the letter good.

I I've tried to convince her she thinks that because it was delivered her by Mambia that was given to her by her right and it's now hers, but it was obviously mine.

It was given to my it's a family heirloom.

I want it back. Un understandable.

Do you think you can get it back for me?

We shall certainly endeavor to do so.

Very good.

I have lots of I can I trust you with this?

I don't want to I've been arguing with her all week.

We can certainly give it a shot.

We can hopefully we'll be back by midnight.

Well, you have like seven hours till midnight.

I will I plan to be asleep with the well before midnight, so I hope that you resolve it well before midnight.

I would hate to get this package delivered to me after midnight.

But if you must, please leave it around the back, do not disturb me. , of.

Or just like coax her head to the side and just sees the kids and goes, I think I can work out why.

I need to finish cooking dinner. Look, do you guys get it to me, are you are you hungry?

Do you want some dinner?

I can I can feed five more.

I think we can wait until we've done our jobs.

I think you get me the lamp I will feed you.

You can share a nice family meal.

That sounds great.

I need to get back cooking.

I'll see you.

I'll see you hopefully in an hour.

See you in an hour.

Hey, we go?

Now, this lady says she has the right to this lamp because it was delivered to her.

I like to ask if I have an understanding of not law, but law is she correct ambia. They got a total of so no but you can see like the school comes with a certain level of prestige.

So there's no reason for this woman to think that it is hers, but like also like people get confused about a thing and it's like she probably does think like she's probably received it with a certain honorific um and if she's just the kind of person that just wants the thing like she'll just hold on that version of the truth, even though it's definitely a lie.

So you're gonna have to convince this woman pretty hard or you could try lie Or you could try other more aggressive methods.

Or you could try straight up theft. What I thought that was what meant by other methods.

What's the other method that's not ia you could intimidate like using the mambia and like threaten, right?

But like that like you would also know that like that sort of stuff, that sort of rumor does fly.

Like that other people would probably hear about it if you do it that way. So yeah, you can try different things.

Well I think maybe it comes to that but I think um there's no reason not to just start off by like having a chat with her disagree.

I have no issue. Do to help you though.

I'm talking good.

Frankhen numbers, you know.

Yes, so you next door I assume you knock on the door Yes, it' firmly but not aggressively on the door. . adults. . Yes.

We are here with the postal department delivered my my beautiful treasure, my beautiful lamp I am it is that' come to the observation that there's been a bit of a discrepancy in our delivery.

It turns out that actually that lamp is not the one that was addressed that was meant for you.

But this is that silly indeed he has been saying this all week, but the Megambia does not make mistakes. With the magic, you could not make afford to make mistakes.

It was delivered to me, so it is mined by a right, yes?

That in fact, is not the case that they's about the delivery.

You're telling me that these you your magicians, you wizards, druids, you all these things.

You make mistakes?

Even the gods make mistakes.

Yes, but must be better.

Better you need to be better are you are our custodians of our town.

You defend us.

You need to be better than the gods. Better but not Indeed you know part of trying to be better . Part of part of us becoming better and part of this town becoming the best that it can be is acknowledging that we do make mistakes and looking to make them rat.

And that's why I beseech here to return the lamp to us so that we can get it to where it belongs.

This is a D. I'm not lie you saved..

I'm like if you want to try to aid, you can, but like obviously like aiding comes at the risk of making it harder.

I mean, I feel like what we have already done implies that assistance occurred in that request.

So, you give a diplomacy role dipl.

I have a diplacy.

Oh, what's that?

And is I is already to live, my friend.

Yep, so you're taking a minus one penalty.

Um, Paul?

Ohthough Gemma, you didn't use your you can reroll, right?

You haven't used your hero point. Heroroll?

That is like so that's a 16 is a success so that is a and I'm diplacy and I got a 18 on dice so that's 25+1 is total . I was so excited about this lamp.

I wanted it so badly.

It was but I guess there's there's been so much arguing this week and the neighbors are talking fine take it I guess um I say oh thank you thank you for your understanding and you know, any day it could be a package for you.

I was going to take a silver out of her pockets and give it to the woman and go for your trouble madam.

I will take this silver, but it is not the same.

This is an incredible lamp.

Agreed it is mere compensation for your trouble.

It is not a good day, but I can be the better person. In all of this. Yes you are.

Yes, yes I am.

Always need to be the better person.

I' the best person in the street and she closes the door behind you and Kira muttering to herself you obviously did not take you an hour, but yeah you have the lamp so we're the right Let's like knock on the door again and just see if she wants to buy a lamp I think we'll make do with the free dinner.

Yeah. Uh yeah you go back, you give the lamp.

You have to sit and wait you get to you you're forced into helping helping her just get kids ready for dinner and get washed up.

Um like yeah, you you're being basically being coerced in the bathing children. Um and things of that nature and getting them dressed.

But you fared a delicious stew of goat with uh vegetables, um like potato and carrots and um uh plantains. Um it's it's hearty and delicious. Um and, yeah, I think we'll we'll fast track um Yeah, by the time you get back home, it's late, um not late late, but like you know, dark already. Um you don't it's been a long day.

You've probably been out basically 12 hours at this point.

We're back in time for second dinner.

I mean, if you I think if you really want it, I think they close the kitchen about nine, didn't they say, so well, like two hours after Sunday.

So I think you basically if you really wanted it, yeah, you could find extra.

That's true.

But yeah, well, you get a chance to wash up, sleep, um when you get back, um it anyway, gives you some more hot ginger beer if you want it as like a nightcap.

Ignasi thank you and says uh yeah, I know that must have been a hard day, but you actually really well.

So next come back tomorrow morning, um and we'll give you an next assignment, uh which will be with the uzanjati.

Have a good sleep. Um, you guys all do have a good sleep.

Sorry, what were you saying, Paul?

I just said yes.

Um, And then in the morning, uh, uh you can you do your morning preparations, do you have like a light breakfast?

Um and do you find aoro and noxolo?

I think you met these guys earlier. Um in the morning.

Sorry.

And uh the paraph an athletic young man weighs enthusiastic from the pathway in front of the dormitory. Off to the side on the mossy earth, a woman in a handsome dashiki sways and casually dances, snapping her fingers to an imaginary beat a bizarre beast resembling a cross between a two foot long crocodile and a bear cub prances and nibbles at her ankles as she shuffles and snaps.

Hi there, the man with a wide smile I amm a coro and this is Noxol we haven't already met, but just you remember my name?

We're part of the uzunati?

Well, not yet, but the tale of our becoming shall be a good tale to hear some day.

The uanjati tell stories to each other and learned new stories in turn.

Today we want you to tell us the story of your past week so that we can learn it and pass it on to others.

It is not only training for you in how to tell a story but training for us and how to be good listeners. We all benefit. Uh that's where we will end it. Um you guys will have a little bit beforeand next session, you guys can prep or not, um but you've basically been asked to tell a story of your first week. And that's all. Cool.

What the heckaking test Iically testing you on your ability to take notes you guys have you have to do any preparation, but I don't know for some of the people some people might like to do a little bit of preparation. In advance.

That's entirely call.

I. But hopefully that was fun. Um again. A bit different.

I think the way that the fact that you guys were able to split it up in three groups meant that you were able to nail the timing. Even if you'd only split it in the two, it would have been hard to do that in daylight.

I may have helped you a little bit with the splitting up but I don't helped you too much.

I think you were already heading in that direction and I just clarified.

Yeah, yeah, because I think I mean, I did specifically ask like, is it worth having all of us on what?

And you pretty much had that straight away.

And I think, yeah, like yes, don't the party, but like you're literally delivering mail yeah, you're in town you should be able to run away from shit if it happens.

I think yeah, like they could have had an account for that, but like it was just a it was a challenge, right?

It was an interesting sk challenge, too, I thought.

Did I have you guys enjoyed it as well?

Yeah, it was most of that was straight from the book.

I just had the a few things.

Like I had the canal boat with the rooster on the bow and um the west person that lived outside the Western Jack, the the really long one that's from the book and Chukwu, um who lives down on the Canal road from the canal.

But I added that it was a try shop because that just sounded fun in the moment.

And I I think you guys would agree.

Yeah.

I did enjoy tossing myself off a tower.

Sounds like that one out of contexting yourself up.

You're jumping from the ground and then you just get 60 feet of air.

What if you jump from the top of the tower?

Like, do you get 60 foot from the top of the tower?

Instant I like how we tried to force the 12 o'clock or the midnight thing as well.

I thought that was a come back like I had a reason to bring it was like this woman to have a package delivered after midnight mechanically that there arees It was that people are generally happy to receive letters at all hours.

But not a woman with fucking a fucking army of children.

If I see my world will beered.

No, I'm not bringing letters here after me that woman will No, that woman would be on her back getting pregnant with more children.

That's why she doesn't like to take anything after midnight. No that's completely wrong Liz because you said it' specifically she doesn't take any packages after the knows. That could have roleplayed more with that the dispute but I think like we did what we needed to get out of it I feel like I don't think we needed to stretch that out all that much more plus it was kind of like that was the hardest check of the day and you guys needed a hero point to get there but it was satisfying that you actually hit the 26.

Yeah.

Well, I mean if we missed theth, there would have been much more roleplay, I think.

Yeah, again, like literally it's got like you can deceive and that'll work. Once you intimidate, it gets back to two of the students and they won't be happy with you at all.

They might not want to be friends and if you steal it and get caught, one of them still not want to be friends. One of them just wouldn't give a shit. A bit describe what your clothing, there was a bit specifically ign was like he says compliments the world-dressed people of the group.

So I was like, that's not a bad time to do a check in of like how are you guys dressing on a daily anyway?

And then it just like let me it gave me an idea of who was well dressed and who was not which didn't really surprise me anyway.

Hey, you didn't say anything to me.

My guy is well dressed?

No, he didn't. Objectively not.

He definitely did I clothes. Clarified, remember.

Phil rolled forced that conversation, I had a differentation of it.

No, you forced that You said these are specifically worn?

I suppose. He also like it was like people well dressed and good looking and I'm sorry but Ignasi's not into ratolk.

I just write that as a note that's . I would if everyone.

That's okay. Doesn't mind.

He's not that kind of person.
