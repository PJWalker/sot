**Success** You succeed in your studies admirably. Increase the level of the branch you chose by 1.

**Failure** You need to work harder and try again. Your branch level remains the same.

**Critical Failure** You make a major mistake that requires you to perform remedial studies. The next time you would get an opportunity to attempt this activity, you must skip that opportunity to catch up.
