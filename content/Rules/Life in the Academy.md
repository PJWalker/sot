In the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, you'll have the opportunity to play characters who are students at the Magaambya, the oldest and most storied magic school in all Golarion. You'll learn new magic, advance in your studies, choose one of the five prestigious branches to join, and more. As you continue your academic career, adventure will call, but you'll never cease to be a Magaambyan, tied inextricably to the thousands upon thousands of students who came before you, stretching across eight millennia of history and tracing back to the legacy of Old-Mage Jatembe, one of the most legendary and powerful wizards in the history of Golarion.

The academia subsystem helps you express your character's academic and intellectual growth throughout your time at the Magaambya, starting as a new initiate struggling to find your place at the school to an academic powerhouse respected by all researchers in your field and beyond. You'll continue your studies alongside your adventuring career, allowing you to gain a series of useful benefits to improve your character's capabilities based on the progress of your academic work.

Classes at the Magaambya are open to students of any branch, but each focuses on the values embodied by a specific branch. If your primary branch is Tempest-Sun Mages and your secondary branch is Rain-Scribes, you'll attend Tempest-Sun Mage classes to advance your level in your primary branch or Rain-Scribe classes to advance your level in your secondary branch. You don't need to create a specific course load or class schedule, since you're always choosing whether to focus on your primary or secondary branch.

# [Branch Skills, Lores, and Feats](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1469)
Each branch has two or three associated skills, one or more subcategories of lore, and a general feat. As you gain levels in your branch, you'll gain benefits that apply to the associated skills and lore, as well as the associated general feat.

# [Changing Branches](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1470)
It's perfectly natural that a player might choose a primary or secondary branch at character creation and, after roleplaying the character for some time, decide it was the wrong branch to represent their character's personality. While your GM could create a downtime activity to allow branch retraining in place of advancing in a branch, this can wind up permanently leaving your character behind the rest of your party. Instead, work with your GM to swap out your branches. Keep in mind, the Magaambya looks extremely poorly on those who flippantly attempt to alter their branches of scholarship to gain personal power and will staunchly deny any such exploit.

Realizing that you're falling behind in your studies, you cram more than you probably should. You [Study](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=752) twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a DC 8 flat check or be [fatigued](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=15) for that day.

# [Branch Benefits](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1472)
At every branch level, you gain the benefit listed in Table 2. The benefit entries below also include the branch levels at which you gain them.

**Cascade Bearers**: Nothing is beyond your imagination. Once per day, you can cast any common 7th-level spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal spell lists without expending a spell slot. When you do, you use your spellcasting proficiency for your halcyon spells.

**Emerald Boughs**: You can stretch your hideaway well beyond the original intended usage, creating a special extradimensional abode in which to rest with your allies, host visiting diplomats, and more. At any time, you can spend 1 minute to enter and expand your hideaway into a [_magnificent mansion_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=183); it remains in this form until you leave, at which point it expels all remaining guests and becomes a normal hideaway as [Emerald Boughs Hideaway](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1111) until you spend another minute to enter and expand your hideaway again.

**Rain-Scribes**: You can adapt to almost any situation. You can survive in [severe and extreme cold and heat](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=642) without taking damage. You move at full Speed through difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain, and take no damage from hazardous terrain.

When you use [Uzunjati Recollection](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1114), you [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26) three times instead of once, each with a +2 circumstance bonus. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check for [Uzunjati Storytelling](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1109) from the captivating combined narrative.
